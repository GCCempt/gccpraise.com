[V1]
.             E                            B
 When the mountains fall and the tempest roars
.             C#m A
 You are with me ||
.        E
 When creation falls
.                    B           C#m
 Still my soul will soar on Your mercy

[P]
.      A
 I'll walk through the fire
.         E
 With my head lifted high
.         C#m
 And my spirit revived
.          B
 In Your story||
.       A
 I'll look to the cross
.       C#m
 As my failure is lost
.          E                     B
 In the light of Your glorious grace
---
[C1]
.                       E
 Let the ruins come to life
.                       A
 In the beauty of Your name
.                    E
 Rising up from the ashes
.                 B
 God forever You reign||
.                       C#m
 And my soul will find refuge
.                       A
 In the shadow of Your wings
.                   E
 I will love You forever
.                  B
 And forever I'll sing


[V2]
.           E
 When the world caves in
.                     B
 Still my hope will cling
.          C#m  A
 To Your promise ||
.           E
 When my courage ends
.                     B
 Let my heart find strength
.         C#m
 In Your presence


[B1]
.       E
 We love You Lord
.    C#m
 We worship You
.     B
 You are our God
.       E
 You alone are good
--- 
 
[B2]
.        E
 You asked your son
.  C#m
 To carry this
.   B
 The heavy cross
.       E
 Our weight on sin ||
.    E
 I love you lord 
.   C#m
 I worship you
.        B
 Hope which was lost
.      E
 Now stands renewed ||
.          E
 I give my life
.         C#m
 To honor this
.            B
 The love of Christ
.            E
 The Saviour King

[E]
.          E
 I give my life
.         C#m
 To honor this
.            B
 The love of Christ
.            E
 The Saviour King</lyrics>
