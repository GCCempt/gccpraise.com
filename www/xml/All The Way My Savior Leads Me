  <lyrics>[V1]
.        G
 All the way my Savior leads me
.         D           G
 What have I to ask beside ||
.      C/G             G/D  D
 Can I doubt His tender mercy
.            A                D
 Who through life has been my Guide ||
. D7       G             
 Heav'nly peace divinest comfort
.         G              D
 Here by faith in Him to dwell ||
.      G               C
 For I know whate'er befall me
.      G/D       D      G
 Jesus doeth all things well ||
.      G               C
 For I know whate'er befall me
.      G/D       D7     G
 Jesus doeth all things well


[V2]
.        G
 All the way my Savior leads me
.             D             G
 Cheers each winding path I tread ||
.         C/G            G/D  D
 Gives me grace for ev'ry trial
.         A                D
 Feeds me with the living bread ||
. D7       G             
 Though my weary steps may falter
.        G              D
 And my soul athirst may be ||
.        G               C
 Gushing from the Rock before me
.     G/D          D  G
 Lo a spring of joy I see ||
.        G                C
 Gushing from the Rock before me
.     G/D         D7  G
 Lo a spring of joy I see


[V3]
.        G
 All the way my Savior leads me
.       D              G
 O the fullness of His love ||
.       C/G            G/D  D
 Perfect rest to me is promised
.       A               D
 In my Father's house above ||
. D7      G             
 When my spirit clothed immortal
.          G                   D
 Wings its flight to realms of day ||
.        G                   C
 This my song through endless ages
.      G/D        D   G
 Jesus led me all the way ||
.        G                    C
 This my song through endless ages
.      G/D        D7  G
 Jesus led me all the way
