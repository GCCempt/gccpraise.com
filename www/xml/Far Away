 Far, Far Away, Far Away, Far Away (you feel so)
 Far, Far Away, Far Away, Far Away
 
[V1]
 Hopeless,
 I can spell it, I can smell it in the air,
 Lotta people wonder if you still care,
 And are you still there, Cause I lost it all||
 I keep calling your name, but do you hear my call
 And are you still involved, At home I'm left alone
 I wander the streets, cause I no longer have a home||
 My Brothers all GONE! My Sisters all GONE!
 My family and my friends ain't gun be here in the mornin'||
 You see me here mournin'
 They say you feel my pain, They say you went through it,
 say die is to gain||
 But I ain't gave nothing, I lost everybody
 Now I'm loosin' my mind and my faith is all I got
 I'm still holding on, that's why I still pray ||
 Feelin' empty inside, I can't make it through the day
 I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
 I'm talking to you now, but I promise that you feel so FAR
 
[C1]
 Far, Far Away (You seem) Far Away (You seem) Far Away (So, So)
 Far, Far Away (You feel) Far Away(You seem) Far Away (So, So)
 Far-Far, Far Away (You feel) Far Away(You seem) Far Away (You're So, So)
 Far, Far Away(You feel) Far Away (You seem) Far Away (So...)
 
[V2]
 Dead hopin' waitin' only for awhile now
 Because the beat that I ain't sure if I can smile now
 Look at this devistation,
 Look at the pain and sorrow,||
 Somebody fed me lies and promise me a bright tomorrow
 I know the God I follow, is bigger than disaster
 Big enough to handle any evil that harass us||
 But I feel like he passed us, Pain overtook us
 Buildings tumbled over head as the ground shook us
 God adieu forsook us
 Are ya still with me?||
 I know you save souls, I trust you to forgive me
 Relief can you hear me? Hey rest can you give me
 Hey peace can you see me, hey Love can you hear me||
 I don't know what to do I ain't lookin' for answers
 I just need you to hold my hand through this cancer||
 Tell me you never left, even in the midst of death
 Breathe on me I'll do anything to feel your breath!
 
[B]
 For God Alone
 Oh My Soul, Wait In Silence
 For My Hope Is From Him
 He Is My Only Rock And My Salvation
 My Fortress- I Shall Not Be Shaken ||
 On God Rests
 My Salvation
 My Glory
 My Mighty Rock
 My Refuge is God||
 Trust In Him At All Times People,
 Pour Your Heart Out Before Him
 God Is A Refuge For Us
... Ye
 
[C2]
 Far, Far Away (HE'S NOT!) Far Away (HE's NOT!) Far Away (HE'S NOT! - YOU KNOW MY GOD! IS NOT!)
 Far, Far Away (HE'S NOT!) Far Away (HE's NOT!) Far Away (HE'S NOT! - YOU KNOW MY GOD! IS NOT!)
 Far, Far Away (He's Not) Far Away (No. He's Not) Far Away (MY GOD IS NOT!)
 Far, Far Away (He's Not) Far Away (He's Not!) Far Away (He's Not)... Yeh!
 
[E]
 We Love You Lord, We Love You Lord,
 We Trust that You are Not that Far Away
 We Love You Lord, We Love You Lord,
 We Trust that You are Not that Far Away ||
 Help Us Be The Church,
 Help Us Be The Church...
 To Love Your People,
 As they Love the World.
 Amen.
