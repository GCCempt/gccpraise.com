[V1]
. F            Bb/F       C/F              F         C/E
   There is a higher throne than all this world has known,
.      Dm                 Bb         Gm7           Csus4 C
  Where faithful ones from every tongue will one day come.||
. F            Bb/F         C/F                F           C/E
   Before the Son we'll stand, made faultless through the Lamb;
.  Dm                  Bb              Gm7         Csus  C
 Believing hearts find promised grace: salvation comes.

[C]
. F/A            F/Bb      Bb C                    Bb/F   F
    Hear heaven's voices sing, their thund'rous anthem rings
.          Dm     Dm/C     Bb             Bb/A Gm7           C
  Through emerald courts and sapphire skies,     their praises rise.||
. F/A          F/Bb        Bb  C                       Bb/F   F
     All glory, wisdom, power, strength, thanks and honour are
.     Dm7    Dm/C      Bb          Bb/A Gm7           Csus  C   F   
  To God, our King who reigns on high,       fore  -   ver more.

[V2]
. F            Bb/F       C/F              F         C/E
  And there we'll find our home, our life before the throne;
.      Dm                 Bb         Gm7           Csus4 C
 We'll honour Him in perfect song where we belong.||
. F            Bb/F         C/F                F           C/E
  He'll wipe each tear-stained eye, as thirst and hunger die;
.  Dm                  Bb              Gm7         Csus  C
 The Lamb becomes our Shepherd King: we'll reign with Him.</lyrics>
