  <lyrics>[V1]
 Just as I am, without one plea, 
 but that thy blood was shed for me, 
 and that thou bidst me come to thee, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 
[V2]
 Just as I am, and waiting not 
 to rid my soul of one dark blot, 
 to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 
[V3]
 Just as I am, though tossed about 
 with many a conflict, many a doubt, 
 fightings and fears within, without, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 
[V4]
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind; 
 sight, riches, healing of the mind, 
 yea, all I need in thee to find, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 
[V5]
 Just as I am, thou wilt receive, 
 wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; 
 because thy promise I believe, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 
[V6]
 Just as I am, thy love unknown 
 hath broken every barrier down; 
 now, to be thine, yea thine alone, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
