[V1]
.           C#m          A    E B  
 You_ were God_ from the outset, 
.     C#m         A E B
 powerful and creative
.           A                   C#m             B
 You who saw us here before You called all the stars 
.        A
 and the earth to existence
 
[V2]
.         C#m          A E B  
 You_ are God  You are holy, 
.      C#m      A E B
 history is Your story
.        A                  C#m           B  
 You who was and is and who forever will be, 
.       A
 God we live for Your glory
 
[V3]
.          C#m         A       E B  
 You_ are God  You are freedom, 
.           C#m         A E B
 You’re alive now within us
.          A                     C#m               B
 You who saw us here before You conquered the grave
.     A
 And delivered on the promise
--- 
[C1]
.            E  
 So we will run, 
.    B                        C#m
 all together our hearts aflame
.       A                  E  
 With a fire that can’t be tamed, 
.    B/F#          E/G#     A      C#m
 our God, all glory to Your name, Jesus
 
[C2]
.         E  
 We will run, 
.       B                      C#m
 our surrender to bring You fame
.      A                E  
 Our desire that You be praised, 
.    B/F#       E/G#       A           C#m
 our God, all glory to Your name, Jesus</lyrics>
