  <lyrics>[V1]
.D2
 When I survey the wonderous cross
 On which the Prince of Glory died
 My richest gain I count but loss
 And pour contempt on all my pride
 
[V2]
.D2
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
 save in the death of Christ my God:
 all the vain things that charm me  most,
 I sacrifice them to his blood.
 
 
[V3]
.D2
 See, from his head, his hands, his feet
 sorrow and love flow mingled down
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
 or thorns compose so rich a crown?
 
[V4]
.D2
 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 that were an offering far too small;
 love so amazing, so divine,
 demands my soul, my life, my all.
 
 
[C]

 Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live||

 All who gather here by grace draw near and bless your name
