[V2]
 Lord, I come to Your awesome presence
 From the shadows into Your radiance.
 By the blood I may enter Your brightness,
 Search me, try me, consume all my darkness. ||
 Shine on me,
 Shine on me.
 
[V3]
 As we gaze on Your kindly brightness
 So our faces display Your likeness.
 Ever changing from glory to glory
 Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story. ||
 Shine on me,
 Shine on me.
