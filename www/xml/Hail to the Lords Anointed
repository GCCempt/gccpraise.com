  <title>Hail to the Lords Anointed</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Hail to the Lord's Anointed,Great David's greater Son!
 Hail, in the time appointed,His reign on earth begun!||
 He comes to break oppression, To set the captive free,
 To take away transgression, And rule in equity.

[V2]
 He comes with comfort speedy, To those who suffer wrong;
 To help the poor and needy, And bid the weak be strong;||
 To give them songs for sighing, Their darkness turn to light,||
 Whose souls, condemned and dying, Were precious in his sight,

[V3]
 He shall come down like showers, Upon the fruitful earth;
 And love, joy, hope, like flowers, Spring in his path to birth;||
 Before him on the mountains, Shall peace, the herald, go;
 And righteousness, in fountains, From hill to valley flow.

[V4]
 O'er ev'ry foe victorious, He on his throne shall rest,
 From age to age more glorious, All-blessing and all-blessed;||
 The tide of time shall never, His covenant remove;
 His Name shall stand for ever â€” That Name to us is Love.</lyrics>
