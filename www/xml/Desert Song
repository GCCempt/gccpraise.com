  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm           A           G     D
 This is my prayer in the desert
.     Bm             A           G  D
 When all thatâ€™s within me feels dry
.Bm         A            G          D
 This is my prayer in my hunger and need
.   Bm         A       G
 My God is the God who provides
 
[V2]
.Bm         A             G   D
 This is my prayer in the fire
.   Bm          A         G  D
 In weakness or trial or pain
.Bm         A               G               D
 There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
.    Bm       D/F#             G
 So refine me Lord through the flame
 
[C]
.                 D                    A
 And I will bring praise, I will bring praise
.          G                       D
 No weapon formed against me shall remain
.A/C#     A               Bm
 I will rejoice, I will declare
.          G           A     Bm
 God is my victory and He is here  
--- 
[V3]
.Bm         A             G     D
 This is my prayer in the battle
.     Bm         A            G  D
 When triumph is still on its way
.Bm     A             G            D
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
.   Bm          A            G
 So firm on His promise I'll stand
 
[B]
.Dsus4     D     Dsus4    D
 All of my life, In every season
.Bm
 You are still God
.                   A
 I have a reason to sing
.G                  D
 I have a reason to worship
 
[V4]
.Bm         A              G     
 This is my prayer in the harvest
.     Bm        A          G   
 When favor and providence flow
.Bm         A            G       
 I know I'm filled to be emptied again
.    Bm           A            G
 The seed I've received I will sow</lyrics>
