  <lyrics>[V1]
 Would you believe me would you listen if i told you that
 There is a love that makes a way, it'll never hold you back
 So wont you break wont you break free
 Get up and dance in His love
 So wont you break wont you break free
 Get up and dance in His love
 
[V2]
 Who would have thought that God would give his one and only son
 Taking a stand upon the cross to show His perfect love
 So wont you break wont you break free
 Get up and dance in his love
 So wont you break wont you break free
 Get up and dance in his love
 His love never ending
 
[C]
 There's no escaping the truth
 There's no mistaking it's You
 God forever we'll
 Get up and dance,
 Get up and dance
 And praise You
 Theres no escaping Your light
 Theres no mistaking Your love
 Across the world we will
 Get up and dance
 Get up and dance and praise You
 
[V3]
 Now is the time to take this freedom that has come our way
 Offer our lives to see the glory of His name
 So wont you break wont you break free
 Get up and dance in his love
 So wont you break wont you break free
 Get up and dance in His love
 His love never ending
 
[V4]
 Living all our days
 We are holding on holding on
 To all Your ways
 We are holding on holding on
 To all You say and You've done
 We are holding on to Your love
 Now we will...
 
[B]
 So won't you break free
 Won't you break free
 Get up and dance
 Wont you break free
