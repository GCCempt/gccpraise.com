;Capo 4*
[V1]
. D2          Am7
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
. C2           G
 Holy, holy is He. ||
.D2             Am7
 Sing a new song to Him who sits on
.C2                 G
 Heaven's Mercy Seat.
 
 
[C]
.D2              Am7
 Holy, Holy, Holy is The Lord, God Almighty.
.C2                        G
 Who was and is and is to come. ||
.D2                       Am7
 With all creation I sing, "Praise to The King of Kings,
.C2                         G                 D2 Am7 C2 G
 You are my everything. And I will adore You."
 
 
[V2]
.D2                  Am7
 Clothed in rainbows, of living color.
.C2                            G
 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder. ||
.D2                               Am7
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be,
.C2                    G
 To You, the only wise King.
 
----
 
[V3]
.D2                  Am7
 Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder,
.C2                     G
 At the mention of Your Name. ||
.D2                        Am7
 Jesus, Your Name is power, breath and living water.
.C2                   G
 Such a marvelous mystery.
 
 
[T]
. D2          Am7
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
. C2           G
 Holy, holy is He.
