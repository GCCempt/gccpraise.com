  <title>On Eagles Wings</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                     Dmaj7
 You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord,
.       G                       Dmaj7
 Who abide in His shadow for life,
.  F                      Dm
 Say to the Lord:"My refuge,
.      F      Gm      Asus4
 My rock in whom I trust!"
 
[C] 
.      A7           D
     And he will raise you up on eagle's wings,
.      Em               A7
     Bear you on the breath of dawn,
.      D            D7            G   Em 
     Make you to shine like the sun,
.      A   Bm      F#m     Em A7        D
     And hold you in the palm of His hand.
 
[V2]
.G                     Dmaj7
 The Snare of the Fowler will never capture you,
.       G                       Dmaj7
 And famine will bring you no fear;
.  F                      Dm
 Under his wings your refuge,
.      F      Gm      Asus4
 His faithfulness your shield
 
[V3]
.G                     Dmaj7
 You need not fear the terror of the night,
.       G                       Dmaj7
 Nor the arrow that flies by the day;
.  F                      Dm
 Through thousands fal about you,
.      F      Gm      Asus4
 Near you it shlat not come

[V4]
.G                     Dmaj7
 For to his angels heâ€™s given a command,
.       G                       Dmaj7
 To guard you in all of your ways;
.  F                      Dm
 Upon their hands they will bear you up,
.      F      Gm      Asus4
 Lest you dash your foot against a stone

[E]
.         Bm  F#m           Em7      A          D
     And hold you, hold you in the palm of His hand.</lyrics>
