  <title>Jesus Loves Me This I Know</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus loves me! This I know
 For the Bible tells me so
 Little ones to Him belong
 They are weak, but He is strong.

[C]
 Yes, Jesus loves me
 Yes, Jesus loves me
 Yes, Jesus loves me
 The Bible tells me so.

[V2]
 Jesus loves me! He who died
 Heaven's gate to open wide;
 He will wash away my sin
 Let His little child come in.

[V3]
 Jesus loves me, loves me stil, 
 Though I;m very weak and ill;
 from his shining throne on high
 Comes to watch me where I lie

[V4]
 Jesus loves me, he will stay
 close beside me all the way;
 if I love him, when I die
 he will take me home on high.

[V5]
 Jesus loves me! This I know
 As He loved so long ago
 Taking children on His knee
 Saying, "Let them come to Me."

[V6]
 Jesus loves me still today
 Walking with me on my way
 Wanting as a friend to give
 Light and love to all who live.
