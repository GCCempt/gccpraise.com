  <lyrics>[V1]
.G   Am   Bm  C        G  
 See amid the winter's snow,
.         C  G        A7  D7 
 Born for us on earth below,
.G       Am     Bm   C    G 
 See the tender Lamb appears,
.Em            C D7    G 
 Promised from eternal years.
 
[C]
.G          C  G D   G   D 
 Hail, thou ever-blessed morn!
.G        C   G     Am G  D 
 Hail, redemption's happy dawn!
.Em           A7  Bm G A7 D 
 Sing through all Jerusalem,
.G         C       D7    G 
 Christ is born in Bethlehem.
 
[V2]
 Lo, within a manger lies
 He who built the starry skies;
 He who, throned in height sublime
 Sits amid the cherubim.
 
[V3]
 Say, ye holy shepherds, say
 What your joyful news today?
 Wherefore have ye left your sheep
 On the lonely mountain steep?
 
[V4]
 "As we watched at dead of night,
 Lo, we saw a wondrous light;
 Angels singing 'Peace on earth'
 Told us of the Saviour's birth".
 
[V5] 
 Sacred infant, all divine,
 What a tender love was thine,
 Thus to come from highest bliss
 Down to such a world as this!
 
[V6]
 Teach, O teach us , Holy Child,
 By Thy Face so meek and mild,
 Teach us to resemble Thee,
 In Thy Sweet humility!
