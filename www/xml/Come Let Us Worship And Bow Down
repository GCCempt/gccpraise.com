.D           Gmaj7           D   A7
 Come let us worship and bow down,
.       G                Em
 Let us kneel before the Lord,
.            G  A
 Our God and Maker.
 
[C]
.    G         Em
 For he is our God,
.    G                        Asus7  A7
 And we are the people of his pasture,
.        G  A7        D  Bm
 And the sheep of his hand,
.        G  A7         D  Gmaj7  A7
 Just the sheep of his hand.
