  <title>O Lord Our Lord How Majestic -Psalm 8</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is
 Your name in all the earth!
 You set Your glory above the skies
 By your Almighty word
 In the sound of childrenâ€™s praise
 You have established strength
 Our eyes we lift,
 How majestic is
 Your name in all the earth!

[V2] 
 O Lord, our Lord when we contemplate
 The beauty of Your works
 O what is man that You think of him,
 Or stoop to give him worth
 Lower than the angel hosts
 With glory we are crowned,
 What joy, what bliss
 How majestic is Your name in all the earth!

[V3] 
 O Lord our Lord You have placed the world
 Beneath our rule and care
 O'er every creature upon the land
 Within the sea and air
 Every breath a gift to praise
 The King all nature serves
 Our song is this
 How majestic is Your name in all the earth

[V4]  
 O Lord our Lord, all creation cries
 The wonders of your name
 Where mountains rise and where oceans kneel,
 All teeming life proclaim
 With the everlasting song
 Of Your redeeming works
 How vast, how rich,
 How majestic is Your name in all the earth

[B] 
 Ha -le -lu -jah
 Ha- le -lu -jah
 O Lord our Lord how majestic is Your name in all the earth.
 
 Ha -le -lu -jah
 Ha- le -lu -jah
 O Lord our Lord how majestic is Your name in all the earth.</lyrics>
