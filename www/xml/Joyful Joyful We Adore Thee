  <lyrics>;Psalm 71:23
[V1]
.E                  B   
 Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
.E            C#m     B
 God of glory Lord of love;
.E                  B
 Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,
.E              B   E
 Opening to the sun above.
 ||
.B        E         B       E
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
.B         E       C#m   B
 Drive the dark of doubt away;
.E          B
 Giver of immortal gladness,
.E                B        E
 Fill us with the light of day! 
 
 
[V2]
 All thy works with joy surround thee, 
 earth and heaven reflect thy rays, 
 stars and angels sing around thee, 
 center of unbroken praise. 
 || 
 Field and forest, vale and mountain, 
 flowery meadow, flashing sea, 
 chanting bird and flowing fountain, 
 call us to rejoice in thee.
 
[V3]
 Thou art giving and forgiving, 
 ever blessing, ever blest, 
 well-spring of the joy of living, 
 ocean depth of happy rest!  
 ||
 Thou our Father, Christ our brother, 
 all who live in love are thine; 
 teach us how to love each other, 
 lift us to the joy divine.
 
[V4]
 Mortals, join the mighty chorus 
 which the morning stars began; 
 love divine is reigning o'er us, 
 binding all within its span. 
 || 
 Ever singing, march we onward, 
 victors in the midst of strife; 
 joyful music leads us sunward, 
 in the triumph song of life.</lyrics></song>
