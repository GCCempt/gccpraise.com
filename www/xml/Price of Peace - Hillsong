[V1]

 My heart a storm, clouds raging deep within

 The Prince of peace came bursting through the wind

 And in Your light I found rest


[C1]
.D                     Em7
 Tearing through the night

 Riding on the storm
.                  G
 Staring down the fight
.                   D
 My eyes found Yours

 The Prince of peace came and broke into my heart
.Bm              F#m               G
  The violent cross, the empty grave

 And in Your light I found grace
