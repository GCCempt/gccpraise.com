  <lyrics>;Matthew 6:9-13 New King James Version
[V1]
 9 In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.||
---
 10 Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven. ||
---
 11 Give us this day our daily bread. 12 And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. ||
---
 13 And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. ||
---
 For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.</lyrics>
