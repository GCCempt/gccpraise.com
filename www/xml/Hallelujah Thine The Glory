  <lyrics>[V1]
 We praise thee, O God!
 For the days of our youth,
 For the bright lamp that shinethâ€”
 The Word of thy truth.
 
[C]
 Hallelujah! thine the glory,
 Hallelujah we sing;
 Hallelujah! thine the glory,
 Our praise now we bring.
 
[V2]
 We praise thee, O God!
 For the Son of thy love,
 For Jesus who died
 And is now gone above.  
 
[V3]
 We praise thee, O God!
 For thy Spirit of light,
 Who has shown us our Saviour
 And scattered our night.  
 
[V4]
 All glory and praise
 To the Lamb that was slain,
 Who has borne all our sins and
 Has cleansed ev'ry stain!
