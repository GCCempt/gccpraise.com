  <lyrics>[V1]
.B			 E
 You're arriving with the sound of thunder and rain
 You're arriving in the calm of the wind and the waves||
 You're arriving in the glow of a burning flame
 A burning flame
 
[V2]
 Praise awaits You at the dawn when the world comes alive
 Praise awaits You in the darkness and shines in the light||
 Praise awaits You with a song of love and desire
 Love and desire
 
[C1]
.		A2		E		  
 Here comes the King All bow down 
.	       B			        
 Lift up your voices Unto the Lamb
.	A2 
 He is the King
.	  E		 B
 All bow down All bow down
 
[V3]
 You are coming again like a thief in the night
 You are coming again with a shout from the sky||
 You are coming again to take away Your bride
 To take away Your bride
 
[B]
.B   A2   	      E
 Yeah, You are the King 
  
[C2]
.		A2		E		  
 You are the King All bow down 
.	       B			        
 Lift up our voices Unto the Lamb
.	A2 
 You are the King
.	  E		 B
 All bow down All bow down
