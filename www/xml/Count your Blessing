  <lyrics>[V1]
. C                                G7
 When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed;
.                                   C   G  C
 When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,||
.                                   G7
 Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
.                                  C    G   C
 And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.
 
 
[C]
 
. C                                   G
 Count your blessings; name them one by one.
.                               C   G    C
 Count your blessings; see what God hath done.||
. C          F          G     F          C
 Count your blessings; name them one by one.
. F               C                   G        C
 Count your many blessings; see what God hath done.
 
[V2] 
 Are you ever burdened with load of care?
 Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?||
 Count your many blessings; ev'ry doubt will fly
 And you will be singing as the days go by.
 
[V3] 
 When you look at others with their lands and gold,
 Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold.||
 Count your many blessings; money cannot buy
 Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.
 
[V4] 
 So amid the conflict, whether great or small,
 Do not be discouraged, God is over all.||
 Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
 Help and comfort give you to your journey's end. 
 
[E]
. F               C                   G        C
 Count your many blessings; see what God hath done.
