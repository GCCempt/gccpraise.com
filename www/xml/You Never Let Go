  <lyrics>;Psalm 150
[V1]
.              G  
 Even though I walk 
.G 
 through the valley of the shadow of death, 
.     C9 
 Your perfect love is casting out fear. 
.                  G 
 And even when I'm caught 
.G
 in the middle of the storms of this life, 
.  C9 
 I won't turn back, I know You are near. 
 
 
[P] 
.                   Em7  D  G 
 And I will fear no ev   -  il, 
.              Em7  D  G
 For my God is wi - th me. 
.                 Em7  D  G
 And if my God is wi - th me, 
.                  D 
 Whom then shall I fear? 
.                  C9 
 Whom then shall I fear? 
 
 
[C] 
.G 
 Oh no, You never let go, 
.G 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
.Em7 
 Oh no, You never let go, 
.Em7 
 In every high and every low 
.D 
 O no, You never let go 
.D                            G   D     C9
 Lord, You never let go of me. 
 
 
[E]
 
.    G                                  D     C9 
 You keep on running and you never let go 
.        C9                         G 
 Singing Lord You never let go of me 
 
 
[V2] 
 And I can see a light 
 that is coming for the heart that holds on 
 A glorious light beyond all compare. 
 And there will be an end 
 to these troubles, But until that day comes, 
 We'll live to know You here on the earth. 
 
[B] 
.G 
 Yes, I can see a light that is coming 
.G 
 for the heart that holds on, 
.                     Em7 
 And there will be an end to these troubles, 
.Em7
 but until that day comes, 
.D 
 Still I will praise You, 
.C9                     G D     C9
