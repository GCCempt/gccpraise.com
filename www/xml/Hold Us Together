[V1]
.C      G/B          Am   F
    It don't have a job 
.C         G/B      Am    F
    Don't pay your bills 
.C         E7        Am
    Won't buy you a home 
.        F
     In Beverly Hills 
.C F C G

[V2]
.C        G/B         Am  F
   Won't fix your life
.C     G/B       Am    F 
   In five easy steps 
.C            E7         Am
   Ain't the law of the land
.       F 
 Or the government 
.C F C G

[P] 
.G
 But it’s all you need... 

[C] 
.C     G/B   Am         F
 Love, will, hold us together 
.C         F
 Make us a shelter 
.    Am          F
 to weather the storm ||
---
.    C     G/B     Am       F
 And I'll  be  my brothers keeper 
.       C                F
 So the whole world will know 
.           G     C
 That we're not alone 

[V3]
.C    G/B          Am  F
 It's waiting for you 
.C        G/B     Am   F
 Knockin' at your door 
.C     E7        Am
 Every moment of truth 
.          F
 When your heart hits the floor 
.C F  G

[P2] 
.G
 And you're on your knees, then 


[B]
.            C      G/B       Am           F
 This is the first day of the rest of your life
.            C     G/B        Am           F 
 This is the first day of the rest of your life
.       C           E7           Am            F
 'Cause even in the dark you can still see the light
.              C        F            C        G       
 It's gonna be alright, it'sgonna be alright
