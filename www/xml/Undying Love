  <lyrics>[V1]
.A          E     
 My ears had heard of You
.A          E
 Now I have seen
.A    E                   A    E
 This bitter sweetness, in Your agony
.A       E      
 My heart was far from You
.   A           E
 But You drew me near||
.G#m        C#m
 With loving kindness
.A          E
 Dried every tear
 
[C]
.              B
 'Cause I can see You
.              C#m          A
 Bearing all my shame on the cross
.     B                 G#     C#m    A
 I can hear You cry out, "It is done"||
.  B                         C#m
 O Jesus, Your sacrifice was more than enough
.       Amaj7       A       E    A E
 In Your death I see undying love
--- 
[V2]
.A          E
 My heart is broken and I'm
.A          E
 Down on my knees
.A    E                   A    E
 To see my Savior suffering for me ||
.A       E  
 But You descended
.   A      E
 Lifting me up
.G#m        C#m  A          E 
 Washing my feet, filling my cup.
 
[E]
.   A   E      A      E
 undying love, undying love</lyrics>
