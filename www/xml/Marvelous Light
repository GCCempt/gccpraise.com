  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                    D
 I once was fatherless,a stranger with no hope
.A                       D
 Your kindness wakened me,wakened me from my sleep ||
.A                          D
 Your love it beckons deeply,a call to come and die
.A                             D
 By grace now I will come and take this life,take Your life
 
[P]
.F#m      E               D
 Sin has lost its power,death has lost its sting
.F#m        E                D
 From the grave You've risen victoriously
 
[C]
.A
 Into marvelous light I'm running,
.D
 Out of darkness,out of shame
.F#m               E
 By the cross You are the truth
.     D
 You are the life,You are the way
 
[V2]
.A                            D
 My dead heart now is beating,my deepest stains now clean
.A                            D
 Your breath fills up my lungs,now I'm free,now I'm free  
 
[B]
.A                             D
 Lift my hands and spin around,see the light that I have found
.F#m    E               D
 O the marvelous light,marvelous light  </lyrics></song>
