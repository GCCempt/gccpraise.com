  <lyrics>[V1]
.   Bm     F#m/A    Em/G   Bm/F#
 To see the King of heaven fall
.   Em7    F#m7     B5 
 In anguish to His knees
.    Bm        F#m/A   Em/G    Bm/F# 
 The Light and Hope of all the world
 
 Now overwhelmed with grief
 
 What nameless horrors must He see
 
 To cry out in the garden
 
 Oh take this cup away from Me
 
 Yet not My will but Yours
 
 Yet not My will but Yours
 
 
[V2]
 
.   Bm        F#m/A       Em/G  Bm/F#
 To know each friend will fall away
.     Em7     F#m7     B5 
 And heaven's voice be still
.    Bm      F#m/A    Em/G    Bm/F# 
 For hell to have its vengeful day
 
 Upon Golgotha's hill
 
 No words describe the Savior’s plight
 
 To be by God forsaken
 
 Till wrath and love are satisfied
 
 And every sin is paid
 
 And every sin is paid
 
 
[V3]
 .     Bm    F#m/A      Em/G    Bm/F#
 What took Him to this wretched place
.     Em7      F#m7     B5 
 What kept Him on this road
.    Bm       F#m/A   Em/G  Bm/F# 
 His love for Adam's curséd race
 
 For every broken soul
 
 No sin too slight to overlook
 
 No crime too great to carry
 
 All mingled in this poisoned cup
 
 And yet He drank it all
 
 The Savior drank it all
 
 The Savior drank it all
