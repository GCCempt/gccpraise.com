. Em D C
[V1]
.      G               Gsus4
 If my heart has grown cold,
.      G                Gsus4
 There Your love will unfold
.    Em7       Bm7        C               D
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand||
.    G                Gsus4
 When I’m blind to my way,
.      G                  Gsus4
 There Your Spirit will pray
.     Em7       Bm7       C                D
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand||
.     Em7       Bm7       C                D
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand


[V2]
.     G               Gsus4
 Present suffering may pass,

 Lord Your mercy will last
.    Em7       Bm7         C               D
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand||
.    G                 Gsus4
 And my heart will find praise,

 I’ll delight in Your way

 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand


[C]
.           G                D
 Oceans will part; nations come
.      C          D         G D
 At the whisper of Your call
.            G              D
 Hope will rise, glory shown
.      C            D         G
 In my life, Your will be done

 Jesus open my eyes to the work of Your hand
