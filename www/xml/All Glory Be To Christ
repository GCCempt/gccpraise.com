  <lyrics>[V1]
.        D              A
 Should nothing of our efforts stand
.   Bm        G
 No legacy survive ||
.   D                 Em
 Unless the Lord does raise the house
.   G         A        D
 In vain its builders strive ||
.    D             A
 To you who boast tomorrow’s gain
.     D                G
 Tell me what is your life ||
.   D          A
 A mist that vanishes at dawn
.     G    A      D
 All glory be to Christ
 
 
[C]
.    D            A
 All glory be to Christ our king
.    D            G
 All glory be to Christ ||
.    D            A
 His rule and reign we’ll ever sing
.     G    A      D
 All glory be to Christ
 
 
[V2]
.      D              Em
 His will be done His kingdom come
.   Bm            G
 On earth as is above ||
.   D                Em
 Who is Himself our daily bread
.        G       A        D
 Praise Him the Lord of love ||
.     D             A
 Let living water satisfy
.     D                G
 The thirsty without price ||
.       D              A
 We’ll take a cup of kindness yet
.     G    A      D
 All glory be to Christ
 
 
[V3]
.     D               Em
 When on the day the great I Am
.      Bm              G
 The faithful and the true ||
.    D                 Em
 The Lamb who was for sinners slain
.    G      A         D
 Is making all things new ||
.   D                 A
 Behold our God shall live with us
.     D                G
 And be our steadfast light ||
.     D                  A
 And we shall e'er his people be
.     G    A      D
 All glory be to Christ
