  <title>I Stand Amazed</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.G
 I stand amazed in the presence
.D           C      G
 Of Jesus the Nazarene,||
.C                      G
 And wonder how He could love me,
.          D         G
 A sinner, condemned, unclean.

[C]
.G
 How marvelous! How wonderful!
.D
 And my song shall ever be,||
.G        D/F# Em7
 How marvelous! How wonderful!
.Am    Em7     D       G
 Is my Saviorâ€™s love for me!

;Instrumental
. G C  Em7 G

[V2]
.G
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
.D           C      G
 He made them His very own;||
.C                      G
 He bore the burden to Calvary,
.          D         G
 And suffered and died alone.


[V3]
.G
 When with the ransomed in glory
.D           C      G
 His face I at last shall see,||
.C                      G
 'Twill be my joy through the ages
.          D         G
 To sing of His love for me.
