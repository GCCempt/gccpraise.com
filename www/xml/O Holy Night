[V1]
.C                 F                   C
 O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
.                       G              C
 It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth ||
.C                     F              C
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining
.         Em             B7            Em
 'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth ||
.  G                  C
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
.   G                C
 For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn
 
[C1]
.Am            Em       Dm             Am
 Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
.  C  G    C  F
 O night divine
.  C   G                C
 O night when Christ was born
.  G       C      C   G            C
 O night, divine, O night, O night divine

[V3]
 Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming

 With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand ||

 So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming

 Here come the wise men from Orient land ||

 The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger

 In all our trials born to be our friend
 
[V2]
.C                              F           C
 Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
.         Em             B7            Em
 And in his name all oppression shall cease ||
.  G                  C
 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
.   G                C
 Let all within us praise his holy name 
 
[C2]
.Am            Em         Dm         Am
 Christ is the lord, that ever, ever praise we
.C G   C F
 Noel, noel!
.    C    G          C
 Oh night, oh night divine!
.  G     C     C     G          C
 Noel, noel! Oh night, oh night divine!
.  G       C   C     G          C
 Noel, noel! Oh night, oh night divine!</lyrics>
