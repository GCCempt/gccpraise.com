[V1]
.Em                         C                D
 To the desperate eyes and reaching hands,
.Em                        C             D
 To the suffering and the lame
.Em                        C                D
 To the ones the world has cast aside
.Am7                             G        D
 Where you want me I will be
 
 
[C1]
.	          C               G
 	I will go, I will go,
.        	  D               Em   D               C
 	I will go, Lord, send me to the world
.	            G                   D
 	To the lost, to the poor and hungry
.	             C                        G
 	Take everything I am
.	              D                            Em 
 	I’m clay within your hands
.           Am7         Em              D
 	I will go, I will go, send me
 
[V2]
 Let me not be blind with privilege,
 Give eyes to see the pain
 Let the blessing you’ve poured out on me
 Not be spent on me in vain
.Am7                   G                         D
 Let this life be used for change
 
[B]
.		C              G
 		I want to live for you
.		D                        Em
 		Go where you need me
.		C              G            D
 		I want to follow you
