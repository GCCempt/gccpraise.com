  <lyrics>[V1]
.G C2
 Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness
.Em7 C2
 with awe and with reverence, bow to adore
.G C2
 You are my Lord, you are my holiness
.Em7 C2
 Jesus my righteousness, I worship you Lord
 
[C]
.G/B C2
 I’m living for your glory
.Em7 Dsus4
 I’m living for the name above all names
.G/B C2
 No one else is worthy
.Em7 Dsus4 D
 No one else can ever take your place
 
[V2]
 I worship you Lord in beautiful holiness
 Lifting up reverence, I bow to adore
 I give you my all, surrendering everything
 my everyday offering: to worship you Lord
 
[T]
.C
 You are high and lifted up
.D
 high and lifted up
.Em7 D/F#
 high and lifted up (x 4)
