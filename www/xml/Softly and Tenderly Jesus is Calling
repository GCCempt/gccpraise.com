  <lyrics>[V1]
. G                  C         G 
 Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
. G          A7/E         D
 Calling for you and for me ||
. G                        C           G
 See, on the portals He's waiting and watching
. G/B      C   G/D     D7  G
 Watching for you and for me


[C]
.      D7         G
 Come home, come home
. D/A       E7     A7   D    D7
 Ye who are weary, come home ||
. G                  C        G
 Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
. G/B     C  G/D    D7   G
 Calling, O sinner, come home


[V2]
. G                        C         G 
 Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading
. G           A7/E         D
 Pleading for you and for me ||
. G                        C            G
 Why should we linger and heed not His mercies
. G/B     C   G/D     D7   G
 Mercies for you and for me


[V3]
. G                         C           G 
 Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing
. G           A7/E         D
 Passing from you and from me ||
. G                     C              G
 Shadows are gathering death-beds are coming
. G/B     C   G/D     D7   G
 Coming for you and for me


[V4]
. G                    C          G 
 O for the wonderful love He has promised
. G           A7/E         D
 Promised for you and for me ||
. G                             C         G
 Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon
. G/B    C  G/D      D7  G
 Pardon for you and for me
