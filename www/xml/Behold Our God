  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                 Em
 Who has held the oceans in His hand?
.C                Em
 Who has numbered every grain of sand?||
.C                  Em
 Kings and nations tremble at His voice
.C            Em7            G
 All creation rises to rejoice

[C1]
.   C   G/B  Am               F
 Behold our God seated on His throne
.             C     G
 Come let us adore Him||
.   C   G/B  Am                  F
 Behold our King, nothing can compare
.             C  G  C     Em    C    Em
 Come let us adore Him!

[V2]
.C             Em
 Who has given counsel to the Lord?
.C                Em
 Who can question any of His words?||
.C                 Em
 Who can teach the one who knows all things?
.C              Em7                    G
 Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?

[V3]
.C                 Em
 Who has felt the nails upon His hands
.C                Em
 Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?||
.C             Em
 God eternal, humbled to the grave
.C              Em7              G
 Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign

[B1]
.C                       F/C
 You will reign forever! (Let Your glory fill the earth)
.C                       F/C
 You will reign forever! (Let your glory fill the earth)||
.Am7                 F/C
 You will reign forever! (Let your glory fill the earth)
.Am7                 F/C
 You will reign forever! (Let your glory fill)</lyrics>
