  <lyrics>[V1]
. G               Am7
 No eye has seen and no ear has heard
.    G/B              C        Dsus
 and no mind has ever conceived
.    G                    Am7
 the glorious things that you have prepared
.    G/B                Dsus    D
 for everyone who has believed;||
. F                           A/C#           A
 You brought us near and you called us your own,
.    Am7                           Dsus D
 and made us joint heirs with your Son.
 
[C]
.    G
 How high and how wide
.    Am7
 how deep and how long
.    F             C/E            Dsus  D
 how sweet and how strong is your love; ||
.    G
 How lavish your grace
.    Am7
 how faithful your ways
.    C             D       G
 how great is your love, O Lord!

[V2]
. G                     Am7
 Objects of mercy, who should have known wrath,
.      G/B                     C    D
 we're filled with unspeakable joy,||
. G                   Am7
 riches of wisdom, unsearchable wealth,
.        G/B                    Dsus   D
 and the wonder of knowing your voice; ||
. F                        A/C#        A
 You are our treasure and our great reward,
.    Am7                   Dsus D
 our hope and our glorious King.
 
[E]
.    C             D       G
 how great is your love, O Lord!</lyrics>
