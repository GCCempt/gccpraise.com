  <lyrics>[V1]
.              C           F        C 
 I sought the Lord and He answered me
.              G              C
 And delivered me from every fear ||
.                   C       F   C 
 Those who look on Him are radiant
.                    G 
 They'll never be ashamed ||
.                    C 
 They'll never be ashamed


[V2]
.                C            F         C 
 This poor man cried and the Lord heard me
.              G          C
 And saved me from my enemies ||
.            C       F          C 
 The Son of God surrounds His saints
.                  G 
 He will deliver them ||
.                  C 
 He will deliver them


[C]
.     Am      F         C 
 Magnify the Lord with me
.        Am      F     Gsus G 
 Come exalt His name together ||
.     Am      F         C 
 Glorify the Lord with me
.        Am      F     Gsus G 
 Come exalt His name forever


[V3]
.             C            F       C 
 O taste and see that the Lord is good
.             G                C
 O blessed is he who hides in Him ||
.             C     F         C 
 O fear the Lord O all you saints
.                     G 
 He'll give you everything ||
.                     C 
 He'll give you everything


[B]
 
 Let us bless the Lord

 Every day and night ||

 Never ending praise

 May our incense rise


[E]
 
 O taste and see that the Lord is good

 O blessed is he who hides in Him
