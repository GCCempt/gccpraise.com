[V1]
.   G        D      G           A
 In Christ alone my hope is found
.D/F#      G     D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 He is my light, my strength, my song ||
.       G     D         G          A
 This Cornerstone, this solid ground
.D/F#             G    D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm ||
.     D/F#       G          D/F#      Asus     A
 What heights of love, what depths of peace
.     D/F#      G             Bm7       Asus  A
 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease ||
.     G    D      G       A
 My Comforter, my All in All
.D/F#        G    D/F# Em7 G/A  D  
 Here in the love of Christ I stand
 
 
 
[V2]
.   G        D      G           A
 In Christ alone, who took on flesh
.D/F#      G     D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Fullness of God in helpless babe ||
.       G     D         G          A
 This gift of love and righteousness
.D/F#             G    D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Scorned by the ones He came to save ||
.     D/F#       G          D/F#      Asus     A
 ‘Til on that cross as Jesus died
.     D/F#      G             Bm7       Asus  A
 The wrath of God was satisfied ||
.     G    D      G       A
 For every sin on Him was laid
.D/F#        G    D/F# Em7 G/A  D 
 Here in the death of Christ I live
 
. Am7  Em7 D Dsus  D

[V3]
.   G        D      G           A
 There in the ground His body lay
.D/F#      G     D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Light of the world by darkness slain ||
.       G     D         G          A
 Then bursting forth in glorious Day
.D/F#             G    D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Up from the grave He rose again ||
.     D/F#       G          D/F#      Asus     A
 And as He stands in victory
.     D/F#      G             Bm7       Asus  A
 Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me ||
.     G    D      G       A
 For I am His and He is mine
.D/F#        G    D/F# Em7 G/A      D 
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ
 
. Am7  Em7 D Dsus  D
. Am7  Em7 D Dsus  D
 
[V4]

 No guilt in life, no fear in death
.D/F#      G     D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 This is the power of Christ in me ||
.       G     D         G          A
 From life’s first cry to final breath
.D/F#             G    D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Jesus commands my destiny ||
.     D/F#       G          D/F#      Asus     A
 No power of hell, no scheme of man
.     D/F#      G             Bm7       Asus  A
 Can ever pluck me from His hand ||
.     G    D      G       A
 ‘til He returns or calls me home
.D/F#        G    D/F# Em7 G/A     D 
 Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand
