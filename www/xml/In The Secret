  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                           A
 In the secret, in the quiet place
.C#m               B        A
 in the stillness, You are there.||
.E                            A
 in the secret, in the quiet hour I wait
.               C#m             B        A
 only for You, cause I want to know you more.
[C]
.E         B         C#m       A             E
 I want to know You, I want to hear your voice,
.          B        A
 I want to know You more. ||
.E         B          C#m       A           E
 I want to touch You, I want to see your face,
.          B         A
 I want to know You more.
[V2]
.E                             A
 I am reaching for the highest goal
.C#m          B           A
 that I might receive the prize.||
.E                              A
 Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside,
.               C#m              B        A
 out of my way, 'cause I want to know You more.</lyrics></song>
