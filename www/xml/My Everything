  <lyrics>;Intro: G Am7 C9 Dsus D
;Ending G  C G 
 
[V1]
.G             Am7 
 When I think  of You 
.C9                       Dsus 
 And all that You've done    for me 
.G                        Am7 
 All the suffering You've   been through 
.C9       Dsus D 
 I'm humbled 
 
[V2] 
 Why would You even care 
 For someone so undeserving 
 The cross yet You chose to bear
 I'm speechless 
 
[C] 
.G                Em 
 You are all I need 
.        Am7      Cm 
 My everything, Jesus 
.           G             Em 
 Your blood has purchased me 
.    Am7             Cm 
 My everything, my everything

[B] 
.Em           Bm              C9 
 I just surrender all of my life 
.            Dsus 
 And let You guide me with Your hands 
.Em                  Bm              C9 
 My heart just wants  to say "I love   You"

 I love   You 
 
 
[O] 
.G           Em 
 Jesus I love  You, I need You

 My heart     and my soul

 I give       You control ||
.G             Em 
 Oh Lord I love   You, I need You 
.        Am7 
 My heart and my soul

 They thirst     for You </lyrics></song>
