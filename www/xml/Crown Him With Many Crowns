  <lyrics>[V1]
. D             Bm    G
 Crown him with many crowns, 
.     D/F#   G   D     A
 the Lamb u-pon his throne!||
.      D  A/C#   Bm   D  E  D   A/C#
 Hark how the heav’n-ly anthem drowns 
.     A    Esus  E  A    
 all music but its own! ||
.   D                  G 
 A-wake, my soul, and sing 
.    E                A 
 of him who died for thee,
.    D/F#     G        A7        D
 And hail him as thy matchless King 
.       G    Asus  A7 D
 Thro’ all e-ter-ni-ty.
 
 
[V2]
. D             Bm      G
 Crown him the Lord of love!  
.   D/F#       G    D    A
 Be-hold his hands and side,
.        D    A/C# Bm D  E   D  A/C#
 Rich wounds, yet vi-si-ble a-bove, 
.     A    Esus  E  A    
 in beauty glo-ri-fied. ||
.    D            G 
 No angel in the sky 
.      E                A 
 can fully bear that sight,
.    D/F#      G         A7       D
 But downward bends his burning eye 
.     G    Asus  A7  D
 at mys-te-ries so bright.
 
 
[V3]
. D             Bm       G
 Crown him the Lord of peace, 
.      D/F#     G   D    A
 whose power a scepter sways ||
.      D   A/C# Bm   D    E    D   A/C#
 From pole to pole, that wars may cease, 
.    A         Esus   E     A    
 ab-sorbed in prayer and praise: ||
.      D                  G 
 His reign shall know no end, 
.     E                 A 
 and round his pierced feet ||
.      D/F#       G     A7       D
 Fair flow’rs of pa-ra-dise extend 
.        G      Asus A7  D
 their fragrance ev-er sweet.
 
 
[V4]
. D             Bm       G
 Crown him the Lord of years, 
.     D/F#  G   D   A
 The Potentate of time ||
.    D A/C# Bm  D  E  D    A/C#
 Cre-a-tor of the rolling spheres,
.   A     Esus  E  A    
 In-e-ffa-bly sub-lime: ||
.     D               G 
 All hail, Redeemer, hail! 
.      E                 A 
 For thou hast died for me: ||
.    D/F#         G      A7     D
 Thy praise shall never, never fail 
.      G      Asus A7 D
 throughout e-ter-ni-ty.
