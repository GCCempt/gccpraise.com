 El Shaddai El Shaddai

 El Elyonna Adonai

 Age to age You're still the same

 By the power of the name

 El Shaddai El Shaddai

 Erkamkana Adonai

 We will praise and lift You high

 El Shaddai


[V1]
 
 Through Your love and through the ram

 You saved the son of Abraham

 Through the power of Your hand

 You turned the sea into dry land

 To the outcast on her knees

 You were the God who really sees

 And by Your might

 You set Your children free


[V2]
 
 Through the years You made it clear

 That the time of Christ was near

 Though the people couldn't see

 What Messiah ought to be

 Though Your Word contained the plan

 They just could not understand

 Your most awesome work was done

 In the frailty of Your Son</lyrics>
