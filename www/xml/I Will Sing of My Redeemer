  <lyrics>[V1]
.       D          A         
 I will sing of my Redeemer,
.        A7               D         
 And His wondrous love to me; ||
.       D               A         
 On the cruel cross He suffered,
.          A7              D         
 From the curse to set me free.
 
[V2]
.       D                   A         
 I will tell the wondrous story,
.        A7             D         
 How my lost estate to save, ||
.       D                  A         
 In His boundless love and mercy,
.          A7              D         
 He the ransom freely gave.
 
[V3]
.       D                 A         
 I will praise my dear Redeemer,
.         A7               D         
 His triumphant pow'r I'll tell, ||
.       D               A         
 How the vic-to-ry He giveth
.          A7              D         
 Over sin, and death, and hell.
 
[V4]
.       D              A         
 I will sing of my Redeemer,
.        A7               D         
 And His heav'nly love to me; ||
.         D                 A         
 He from death to life hath brought me,
.          A7              D         
 Son of God, with Him to be.
 
[C]
.          G             D         
 Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,
.         A   A7             D   D7        
 With His blood He purchased me, ||
.        G                 D         
 On the cross He sealed my pardon,
.         A    A7            D         
 Paid the debt, and made me free.
