[V1]
.F          G       C        Dm   C G
 Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,
.C       F  C          G
 Slain for us: and we remember
.F           G        C      Dm   C  G
 The promise made that all who come in faith
.C     F        G      C
 Find forgiveness at the cross.
 
[C1]
.      F             C     F  G
 So we share in this Bread of life,
.       F            C  F G
 And we drink of His sacrifice,
.     F           C     F  G
 As a sign of our bonds of love
.F          F     G      C
 Around the table of the King.
 
[V2]
.F          G       C        Dm   C G
 The body of our Savior, Jesus Christ,
.C       F  C          G
 Torn for you: eat and remember
.F           G        C      Dm   C  G
 The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life,
.C     F        G      C
 Paid the price to make us one.
--- 
[V3]
.F          G       C        Dm   C G
 The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
.C       F  C          G
 Shed for you: drink and remember
.F           G        C      Dm   C  G
 He drained death's cup that all may enter in
.C     F        G      C
 To receive the life of God.
  
[V4]
.F          G       C        Dm   C G
 And so with thankfulness and faith
.C       F  C          G
 We rise to respond: and to remember.
.F           G        C      Dm   C  G
 Our call to follow in the steps of Christ
.C     F        G      C
 As His body here on earth.
 
[C2]
.      F            C   F G
 As we share in His suffering,
.      F                  C    F G
 We proclaim: Christ will come again!
.          F           C     F  G
 And we'll join in the feast of heaven
.F          F     G      C
 Around the table of the King. 
 
[E]
.F          F     G      C
 Around the table of the King.</lyrics>
