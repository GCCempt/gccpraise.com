  <lyrics>[V1]
 Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
 To His feet thy tribute bring.||
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
 Who like me His praise should sing? ||
 Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him,
 Praise the everlasting King. 
  
[V2]
 Praise Him for His grace and favor
 To our fathers in distress.||
 Praise Him, still the same forever,
 Slow to chide and swift to bless; ||
 Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him,
 Glorious in His faithfulness. 
  
[V3]
 Frail as summer's flower we flourish:
 Blows the wind, and it is gone.||
 But while mortals rise and perish,
 God endures unchanging on. ||
 Praise Him, Praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him,
 Praise the high eternal One! 
  
[V4]
 Fatherlike He tends and spares us;
 Well our feeble frame He knows.||
 In His hands He gently bears us,
 Rescues us from all our foes.||
 Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him,
 Widely as His mercy goes.
---  
[V5]
 Angels, help us to adore Him:
 Ye behold Him face to face;||
 Sun and moon, bow down before Him:
 Dwellers all in time and space. ||
 Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him,
 Praise with us the God of grace.
