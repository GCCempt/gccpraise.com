  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                  D/F#               C
 Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside
.G                              D/F#
 The sound of angels’ awe, || the sound of angels’ songs
.C                    Am                      C
 All this for a king, we could join and sing, all to Christ the King
 
[P1]
.D              C           D                      C
 How constant, how divine, this song of ours will rise
.D                      C              D                          C
 Oh, how constant how divine, this love of ours will rise, will rise
 
[C1]
.G             D/F#          Em7          C     Am
 O praise Him, O praise Him, He is Holy, he is Holy
 
[V2]
.G                    D/F#              C
 Turn your gaze to heaven and raise a joyous noise
.G                                 D/F#
 The sound of salvation come, || the sound of rescued ones
.C                     Am                          C
 All this for a king, angels join to sing, all for Christ our King
 
[P2]
.D               C           D         C
 How infinite and sweet, this love so rescuing
.D             C                            D                           C
 Oh, how infinitely sweet, || this great love that has redeemed, as one we sing
 
 
[C2]
.G           D/F#         Em7      C     Am
 Allelulia, Allelulia, He is Holy, He is Holy</lyrics>
