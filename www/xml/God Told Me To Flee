  <lyrics>[V1]
 God told me to flee
 and God still says to flee
 Flee from sexual immorality
 turn and run away
 ||
 Let your mind transcend to the latter end
 Don’t lust in your heart for the beauty that will depart
 || 
 Beauty is so fleeting
 and charm is so deceptive
 But the one who fears the Lord will always be praised
 ||
 Yes they will – so let your mind transcend to the latter end
 Don’t lust in your heart for the beauty that will depart
 || 
 Do you know what it means my friend 
 to have the fear of the Lord within?
 The Bible says it means to hate and turn away from sin
 ||
 Keep your mouth from evil your lips form speaking lies
 Turn from the evil and do good seek peace and pursue it all of your life
 || 
 The Bible says that Jesus He is our Peace
 He died on the Cross for our release 
 He rose from the dead so reigning sin in us might cease
 ||
 And that He’d live within as the King on the throne in our hearts
 Ruling over every one of our parts
 He made us holy for His glory and that ain’t no story
 || 
 God tells us to flee
 for God made each of us to be
 a holy temple His very own property
 ||
 So let’s not interfere with God’s domain where His Spirit now remains
 Let’s yield our body let’s not steal what’s not our property
 || 
 The Bible says that Jesus He is our Peace
 He died on the Cross for our release 
 He rose from the dead so reigning sin in us might cease
 ||
 And that He’d live within as the King on the throne in our hearts
 Ruling over every one of our parts
 He made us holy for His glory and that ain’t no story
 || 
 God tells us to flee
 for God made each of us to be 
 a member of the Body of Jesus Christ His very own wife
 ||
 So let’s not beat up His bride but let’s give our lives to the Lord
 As sacrifices holy and pleasing to the Lord
 let’s be zealous to flee from sexual immorality
 For God says flee
