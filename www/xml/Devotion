  <lyrics>[V1]
. C                    D                         
 I've been running, trying to be one who sees
. Em
 I've been working, this salvation out of my knees
. C                 D                     Em
 There is nothing better than knowing we are redeemed
 ||
 Unbelieving, trusting in creative hands
. I am praying for our world to bow to Your plan
 And this one thought is unmistakable
. Em					C  D
 I take up my cross and follow You, Lord 
 
[C]
. G                                                    
 When You stand the tall trees and mountains bow           
. Em
 When You speak the fiercest of oceans is still||
. C           D
 And I see sinner seeks devotion
.     Em 						C D Em
 The lost become chosen and I fall to my knees
 
[V2]
. C                 D                                  
 I'm forgiven by a Saviour who did not deserve death
. Em
 He was blameless, I was lost in shamefulness||
. C                    D
 I'm delivered, but it doesn't seem right
. Em									C
 Unless I keep my eyes focused on the Saviour who gave His life
 ||
 In the middle of a world that denies it believes
 It is breaking apart at the very seams
 There is one thing to be alive for
 And it's to take up my cross and follow You, Lord 
 
;Instrumental: C  D  Em  Em x2
 
[B]
. G 					C
 I will take up my cross and follow Lord, where You lead me
. Em				 D            C
 I will take up my cross and follow wherever You go (2x)
