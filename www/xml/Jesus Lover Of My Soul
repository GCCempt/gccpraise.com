  <lyrics>[V1]
.G C
 Jesus, lover of my soul,
.G C
 Let me to Thy bosom fly,
.G C
 While the nearer waters roll,
.G C
 While the tempest still is high.||
.D C G
 Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
.D C
 ’Til the storm is past;
.D C G
 Safe into the haven guide;
.Em D C
 Receive my soul at last.
 
[V2]
 Other refuge have I none,
 I helpless, hang on Thee;
 Leave, oh leave me not alone,
 Support and comfort me.||
 All my trust on Thee is stayed,
 All help from Thee I bring;
 Cover my defenseless head
 In the shadow of Thy wing.
 
[V3]
 Thou, O Christ, are all I want,
 Here more than all I find;
 Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
 Heal the sick, and lead the blind.||
 Just and holy is Thy Name,
 I am all unrighteousness;
 False and full of sin I am;
 Thou full of truth and grace.
 
[V4]
 Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
 Grace to cover all my sin;
 Let the healing streams abound;
 Make and keep me pure within.||
 Thou of life the fountain art,
 Let me take of Thee;
 Spring Thou up within my heart;
 To all eternity.
 To all eternity.
