  <title>Facing A Task Unfinished</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.   C              G
 Facing a task unfinished
.      F        G       C
 That drives us to our knees
.  C             F
 A need that, undiminished
.  Dm                 G
 Rebukes our slothful ease||
.    C           F       C
 We, who rejoice to know Thee
. Am              Dm
 Renew before Thy throne
.      C              F  
 The solemn pledge we owe Thee
.  Dm      G          C
 To go and make Thee known


[V2]
.       C            G
 Where other lords beside Thee
.      F       G       C
 Hold their unhindered sway
.       C            F
 Where forces that defied Thee
.Dm               G
 Defy Thee still today ||
.      C                 F  C
 With none to heed their crying
.    Am                   Dm
 For life, and love, and light
.  C                  F
 Unnumbered souls are dying
.    Dm    G        C
 And pass into the night

[C1] 
.   G               C
 We go to all the world
.      G             C
 With kingdom hope unfurled
.   F     G         Em      Am
 No other name has power to save
.    Dm     G         C
 But Jesus Christ The Lord 

[V3]
.   C                   G
 We bear the torch that flaming
.     F        G         C 
 Fell from the hands of those
.   C                   F
 Who gave their lives proclaiming
.     Dm             G
 That Jesus died and rose ||
.     C            F  C
 Ours is the same commission
.    Am                Dm
 The same glad message ours
.      C             F
 Fired by the same ambition
.   Dm       G         C
 To Thee we yield our powers

[V4]
.  C            G
 O Father who sustained them
.   F     G     C
 O Spirit who inspired
.  C                     F
 Saviour, whose love constrained them
.  Dm                G
 To toil with zeal untired ||
.     C          F     C
 From cowardice defend us
.     Am        Dm
 From lethargy awake!
.      C                F
 Forth on Thine errands send us
.   Dm    G        C
 To labour for Thy sake


[C2]
.  G               C
 We go to all the world
.      G             C
 With kingdom hope unfurled
.   F     G         Em      Am
 No other name has power to save
.    Dm     G         C
 But Jesus Christ The Lord ||
.  G               C
 We go to all the world
.      G             C
 With kingdom hope unfurled
.   F     G        Em       Am 
 No other name has power to save
.    Dm     G         C
 But Jesus Christ The Lord </lyrics>
