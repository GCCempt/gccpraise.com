.    D                 A                  G                A      D
 My hope is built on nothing less, than Jesus' blood and righteousness ||
.   D                   A                   G              A      D
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name

 On Christ, the solid rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand ||
.A/G D/F#   G     Bm  A        D    G/D  D
 All other ground is sinking sand

.      D                   A             G              A        D
 When darkness veils his lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace ||
.     D              A               G              A       D
 In every high and stormy gale, My anchor holds within the veil
 
[V3]
.     D              A                  G                A      D
 His oath, His covenant, His blood support me in the whelming flood ||
.      D             A                   G              A        D
 When all around my soul gives away, He then is all my hope and stay
 
 
[V4]
.      D                   A                G             A       D
 When He shall come with trumpet sound, Oh may I then in Him be found ||
.         D              A                  G               A         D
 Dressed in His righteousness alone, fault-less to stand before the throne</lyrics>
