  <title>Glorious Things Of Thee Are Spoken</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 Glorious things of thee are spoken,

 Zion, city of our God;||

 He, whose word cannot be broken,

 Formed thee for His own abode.||

 On the Rock of Ages founded,

 What can shake thy sure repose?||

 With salvation's walls surrounded,

 Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.


[V2]
 
 See, the streams of living waters,

 Springing from eternal love,||

 Well supply thy sons and daughters,

 And all fear of want remove:||

 Who can faint, while such a river

 Ever flows their thirst to assuage?||

 Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,

 Never fails from age to age.


[V3]
 
 Round each habitation hov'ring,

 see the cloud and fire appear||

 for a glory and a cov'ring,

 showing that the Lord is near;||

 thus deriving from their banner

 light by night and shade by day,||

 safe they feed upon the manna

 which he gives them when they pray.


[V4]

 Saviour, if in Zion's city

 I, through grace, a member am,||

 Let the world deride or pity,

 I will glory in Thy name:||

 Fading is the sinner's pleasure,

 All his boasted pomp and show;||

 Solid joys and lasting treasure

 None but Zion's children know.</lyrics>
