  <lyrics>[V1]
.Am         G       Gtrans
 I've tried more of me  
.F
 and I've come up dry
.Am   G             Gtrans
 trading You for things
.F
 things that go away ||
.Am       G               Gtrans
 my happiness is found in less
.          F       Am
 of me and more of You
.          G                Gtrans
 my happiness is found in less
.           F
 of me and more 
 
[C]
.C                 G
 I have found the answer is
.Am                 G                F
 to love You and be loved by You alone
.      C        F        G
 alright, alright, alright ||
.    C           G                Am
 You crucify me and the world to me
.           G               F
 and I will only boast in You
.      C         F        G
 alright, alright, alright
 
[V2]
.Am    G        Gtrans
 I'm so satisfied
.F                   Am
 at the thought of You
.      G        Gtrans
 growing up in me
.F                 Am
 covering everything ||
.          G                 Gtrans
 my happiness is found in less
.           F         Am
 of me and more of You
.          G                 Gtrans
 my happiness is found in less
.           F 
 of me and more 
 
[B]
.C             F
 You are, You are (You're loved by me)
.C             F
 You are, You are (You're loved by me)
.C             F
 You are, You are (You're loved by me)
.C             F        G
 You are, You are, You are</lyrics>
