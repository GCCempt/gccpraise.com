  <lyrics>[V1]
.    D
 You lived among the least of these
.    A
 The weary and the weak
.    Bm                        G
 And it would be a tragedy for me to turn away.
 ||
.D
 All my needs you have supplied.
.A
 When I was dead you gave me life.
.Bm                               G
 How could I not give it away so freely?
 
[C]
.A        D
 And I'll follow you into the homes of the broken.
.A
 Follow you into the world.
 ||
.Em                     G            A
 Meet the needs for the poor and the needy, God.
.D
 Follow you into the World.
 
[V2]
.    D
 Use my hands, use my feet
.    A
 To make your kingdom come
.    Bm                        G
 Through the corners of the earth until your work is done||
---
.D
 'Cause Faith without works is dead
.A
 And on the cross your blood was shed
.Bm  
 So how could I not give it away so freely?
 
 
[B]
.  G           D/F#
 I give all myself.
.  G           D/F#
 I give all myself
.  G           D/F#       A
 I give all myself... to you, Oh Lord
 
[E]
.D         
 Follow you into the homes of the broken
.A
 Follow you into the world.
 ||
.Em                     G            A
 Meet the needs for the poor and the needy God.
.D
 Follow you into the World.
