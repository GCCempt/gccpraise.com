 God is able
.        D
 He will never fail
.Em            Cadd9
 He is almighty God||
.             G
 Greater than all we seek

 Greater than all we ask
.Em     Cadd9      D
 He has done great things
 
 
[C]
.G                   D
 Lifted up, He defeated the grave
.Em       D      Cadd9
 Raised to life, our God is able

 In his name, we overcome
. Em        D      Cadd9
 For the Lord, our God is able

 God is on our side
 He will make a way||
 Far above all we know
 Far above all we hope
 He has done great things
