  <title>Glory to His Name</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Down at the cross where my Savior died
 Down here for cleansing from sin I cried ||
 There to my heart was the blood applied
 Glory to His name

[C]
 Glory to His name glory to His name
 There to my heart was the blood applied ||
 Glory to His name

[V2]
 I am so wondrously saved from sin
 Jesus so sweetly abides within ||
 There at the cross where He took me in
 Glory to His name

[V3]
 O precious fountain that saves from sin
 I am so glad I have entered in ||
 There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean
 Glory to His name

[V4]
 Come to this fountain so rich and sweet
 Cast Thy poor soul at the Savior's feet ||
 Plunge in today and be made complete
 Glory to His name
