[V1]
.         E
 In the hours of pain and sorrow,
 When the world brings no relief
 When the eye is dim and heavy,
 And the heart oppressed with grief
.               A Asus A
 While blessings flee,
.              E
 Savior Lord we trust in Thee!
.               A Asus A
 While blessings flee,
.              E
 Savior Lord we trust in Thee!
 
 
[V2]
 When the snares of death surround us,
 Pride, ambition, love of ease
 Mammon with her false allurements,
 Words that flatter, smiles that please
 Then ere we yield,
 Savior Lord be Thou our shield
 Then ere we yield,
 Savior Lord be Thou our shield
 
[V3]
 When forsaken in distress,
 Poor despised and tempest-tossed
 With no anchor here to stay us,
 Drifting, sail and rudder lost
 Then save us Thou,
 who trod this earth with weary brow
 Then save us Thou,
 who trod this earth with weary brow
 
[V4]
 Thou the hated and forsaken,
 Thou the bearer of the cross
 Crowned of thorns and mocked and
 smitten, Counting earthly gain but loss
 When scorned are we,
 We joy to be the more like Thee
 When scorned are we,
 We joy to be the more like Thee
 
[V5]
 Thou the Father’s best beloved,
 Thou the throned and sceptered King
 Who but Thee should we adoring,
 All our prayers and praises bring?
 So blessed are we,
 Savior Lord in loving Thee
 So blessed are we,
 Savior Lord in loving Thee.

 When the world brings no relief
 When the eye is dim and heavy,
 And the heart oppressed with grief

 Savior Lord we trust in Thee!
