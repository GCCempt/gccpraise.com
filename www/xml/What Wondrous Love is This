  <lyrics>[V1]
 What wondrous love is this, 
 O my soul, O my soul, 
 what wondrous love is this, O my soul! ||
 what wondrous love is this
 that caused the Lord of bliss,
 to bear the dreadful curse 
 for my soul, for my soul,
 to bear the dreadful curse for my soul!
 
[v2]
 To God and to the Lamb,
 I will sing, I will sing,
 to God and to the Lamb, I will sing; ||
 To God and to the Lamb, 
 who is the great I AM,
 while millions join the theme,
 I will sing, I will sing,
 while millions join the theme, I will sing!
 
[v3]
 And when from death I'm free,
 I'll sing on, I'll sing on,
 and when from death I'm free, I'll sing on; ||
 and when from death I'm free,
 I'll sing and joyful be,
 and through eternity
 I'll sing on, I'll sing on,
 and through eternity I'll sing on!</lyrics></song>
