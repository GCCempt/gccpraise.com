;        G  C  G  D/F#  C  Em7sus  D
[V1]
.G                  C    G         D/F# C   Em7sus   D
 Our God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come
.G                    C      G          D/F# C  Em7sus D
 Our shelter from the stormy blast, and our  e- ternal home
 
[V2]
.C         G      C      G       C            G       D
 Under the shadow of your throne, your saints have dwelt secure,
.C             G     C    G     C       Em7sus     D
 Sufficient is your arm alone, and our defense is sure.
  
;CCC  EmEmEm   D
[V3]
.G                   C     G         D/F# C   Em7sus     D
 Before the hills in order stood, or earth re-ceived her frame,
.G                C        G       D/F# C    Em7sus    D
 From everlasting you are God, to end-less years the same
 
[V4]
.C            G     C       G       C             Em7sus D
 A thousand ages in your sight are like an evening gone;,
.C            G       C    G     C           Em7sus  D
 short as the watch that ends the night before the rising sun.
 
[V5]
.C            G     C       G       C             Em7sus D
 The busy tribes of flesh and blood, with all their lives and cares,
.C            G       C    G     C           Em7sus  D
 are carried downward by your flood, and lost in foll'wing years.
 
[V6]
.C            G     C       G       C             Em7sus D
 Time, like an ever, rolling stream, bears all its sons  away,
.C            G       C    G     C           Em7sus  D
 They fly, forgotten, as a dream, dies at the opening day.
 
;CCC  EmEmEm   D
 
[V7]
.G                 C    G         D/F# C   Em7sus   D
 Our God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come,
.G                       C          G         D/F# C  Em7sus D/F# G
 O be our guard while troubles last, and our  e-ter-nal  home.
