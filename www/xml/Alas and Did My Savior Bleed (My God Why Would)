  <lyrics>[V1]
 Alas, and did my Savior Bleed
 And did my Sov-'reign die?
 Would he devote that sacred head
 For such a worm as I? ||
 Was it for sins that I had done
 he groaned up-on the tree?
 Amazing pity, grace unknown
 and love beyond degree
 
[C]
 My God, why would you shed your blood
 so pure and undefiled
 to make a sin-ful one like me
 your chosen pre-cious child?
 
[V2]
 Well might the sun in darkness hide
 and shut his glories in
 When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
 for man the creature's sin. ||
 Thus might I hide my blushing face
 while his dear cross appears.
 Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
 and melt my eyes to tears.
