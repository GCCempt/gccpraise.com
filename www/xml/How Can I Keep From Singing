  <lyrics>;Intro: G  C  G  D (X2)
[V1]
.            G                    D/F#
 There is an endless song echoes in my soul
.  Em7 D/F# G  G/B   C
 I hear the music ring ||
.               G                    D/F#
 And though the storms may come I am holding on
. Em7 D/F# G  G/B   C
 to the rock I cling

[C]
.G                              D
 How can I keep from singing Your praise
.           C          G/B        C              D
 How can I ever say enough, how amazing is Your love ||
.G                             D
 How can I keep from shouting Your Name ||
.             C            G/B          C         D            G
 I know I am loved by the King, and it makes my heart want to sing

[V2]
.       G                   D/F#
 I will lift my eyes in the darkest night
.      Em7               C
 For I know my Saviour lives||
.            G                           D/F#
 And I will walk with You knowing You’ll see me through
.    Em7      G         C
 And sing the songs You give

[B]
.       Am7          G/B           C           D
 I can sing in the troubled times sing when I win
.       Am7        G/B            C              D
 I can sing when I lose my step and fall down again ||
.       Am7           G/B         C                 D
 I can sing cause You pick me up sing cause You’re there ||
.       Am7           G/B                 C                 D
 I can sing cause You hear me Lord when I call to You in prayer||
.      Am7           G/B        C            D
 I can sing with my last breath sing for I know ||
.      Am7                 G/B           C                 D
 That I’ll sing with the angels and the saints around the throne

[E]
 I am loved by the King, and it makes my heart want to sing
