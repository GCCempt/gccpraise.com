[V1]
.  D        A             G
 O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
.         D        G             A
 Greatest treasure of my longing soul ||
.   D         A/C#            Bm
 My God, like You there is no other
.       G        A             D
 True delight is found in You alone, ||
.     G        Bm               A
 Your grace, a well too deep to fathom
.     G      Bm                 A
 Your love exceeds the heavens' reach ||
.     D        A/C#             Bm  A  G
 Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom,
.          D        A            D A/C# G
 My highest good and my unending need

 O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer

 Strong defender of my weary heart ||
.   D        A/C#              Bm
 My sword to fight the cruel deceiver
.       G       A                  D
 And my shield against his hateful darts ||
.   G          Bm         A
 My song, when enemies surround me
.   G          Bm              A
 My hope, when tides of sorrow rise ||
.   D         A/C#        Bm   A  G
 My joy, when trials are abounding
.             D        A             D A/C# G 
 Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night

 O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer,

 Gracious Savior of my ruined life ||
.   Bm        A/C#               Em
 My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders
.      G         A                 D
 In my place You suffered bled and died ||
.    G         Bm                  A
 You rose, the grave and death are conquered
.    G        Bm               A
 You broke my bonds of sin and shame ||
.    G         Bm                  A
 You rose, the grave and death are conquered
.    G        Bm               A
 You broke my bonds of sin and shame

 O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
.           D          A             D   A/C# 
 May all my days bring glory to Your name ||
.           G          A             D   A/C#  G  D
