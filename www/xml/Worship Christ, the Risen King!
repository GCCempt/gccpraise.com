  <lyrics>[V1]
 Rise O Church and lift your voices
 Christ has conquered death and hell ||
 Sing as all the earth rejoices
 Resurrection anthems swell ||
 Come and worship, come and worship
 Worship Christ the Risen King

[V2]
 See the tomb where death had laid Him
 Empty now its mouth declares ||
 Death and I could not contain Him
 For the throne of life He shares||
 Come and worship, come and worship
 Worship Christ the Risen King

[V3]
 Hear the earth protest and tremble
 See the stone removed with pow'r ||
 All hell's minions may assemble
 But cannot withstand His hour ||
 He has conquered, He has conquered
 Christ the Lord the Risen King

[V4]
 Doubt may lift its head to murmur
 Scoffers mock and sinners jeer ||
 But the truth proclaims a wonder
 Thoughtful hearts receive with cheer ||
 He is risen, He is risen
 Now receive the Risen King

[V5]
 We acclaim Your life O Jesus
 Now we sing Your victory ||
 Sin or hell may seek to seize us
 But Your conquest keeps us free ||
 Stand in triumph, stand in triumph
 Worship Christ the Risen King</lyrics>
