 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.

 Holy, holy is He.

 Sing a new song to Him who sits

 Clothed in rainbows, of living color.
.C2                            G
 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder.
.D2                               Am7
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be,
.C2                    G
 To You, the only wise King.

.D2                  Am7
 Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder,
.C2                     G
 At the mention of Your Name.
.D2                        Am7
 Jesus, Your Name is power, breath and living water.

 Such a marvelous mystery.
