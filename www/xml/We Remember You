[V1]
 We remember you 
 We remember you 
 By your sacrifice of love 
 All glory now is due|| 
 
 At this table here 
 Mercy hovers near 
 Thanks is offered up 
 In this bread and cup 
 We remember you 
 
[V2]
 Precious risen Lamb 
 Jesus who was slain 
 Now enthroned in glory 
 Forever you will reign|| 
 
 Gladly we embrace 
 Both these signs of grace 
 Thanks is offered up 
 In this bread and cup 
 We remember you</lyrics></song>
