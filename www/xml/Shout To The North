  <lyrics>[V1]
.         G         D       C
 Men of faith, rise up and sing
.        G         D        C
 Of the great and glorious King
.          G          D        C
 You are strong when you feel weak,
.         G      D         C
 In your broken-ness, complete.
 
[C]
.G              C             D
 Shout to the north and the south.
.G            C            D
 Sing to the east and the west.
.Em        C           D
 Jesus is Saviour to all,
.C        D           G
 Lord of heaven and earth.
 
[V2]
 Rise up women of the truth
 Stand and sing to broken hearts
 Who can know the healing power
 Of our glorious King of love?
 
[B]
.Em                        C
 We've been through fire, we've been through rain.
.Em                         C
 We've been refined by the pow'r of His name
.Em                  C
 We've fallen deeper in love with You.
.                               Dsus  D
 You've burned the truth on our lips.
 
[V3]
 Rise up church with broken wings;
 Fill this place with songs again
 Of our God who reigns on high.
 By His grace again we'll fly.

[E]
 Lord of heaven and earth.
