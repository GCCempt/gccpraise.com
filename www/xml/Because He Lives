  <lyrics>[V1]
. G                                  C
 God sent His son, they called Him, Jesus;
.           G                  C    D7
 He came to love, heal and forgive; ||
.             G    G7           C
 He lived and died   to buy my pardon,
.           G                 D               G
 An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!
 
 
[C]
. G               G7             C
 Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
.            G                  D
 Because He lives, all fear is gone; ||
.          G D G             C
 Because I know He holds the future,
.             G                 D               G
 And life is worth the living, Just because He lives!
 
 
[V2]
. G                           C
 How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
.               G               C    D7
 And feel the pride and joy he gives; ||
.            G D G             C
 But greater still the calm assurance:
.                G              D               G
 This child can face uncertain days because He Lives!
 
 
[V3]
. G                                C
 And then one day, I'll cross the river,
.                   G              C    D7
 I'll fight life's final war with pain; ||
.            G D G                C
 And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
.               G              D                G
 I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!</lyrics>
