[V1]
 All creation is a song
 Waiting to be sung
 All of nature like a prayer
 Waiting for a tongue ||
 But who will give it voice
 And make its anthem ring
 Or rise to lead a choir
 Of all created things?
 Lord hear your people sing
 
[C]
 Blessing honour glory power
 To Creations' King
 Songs of earth and songs of heaven
 Join as one to bring
 Blessing honour glory power
 To Creations' King
 
[V2]
 All the nations are a song
 Waiting to be sung
 Every instrument and voice
 Created for the One ||
 The Maker of all things
 Majesty above
 Who bought us back from death
 With such a costly love
 What praise could be enough?
 
[B]
 Angels gather 'round Your throne,
 every race and nation singin'
 They all bow down to You alone
 Oh, they're singin'</lyrics></song>
