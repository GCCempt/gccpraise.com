  <lyrics>[V1]
.      Bb            Eb     Bb/D
 Come, people of the Risen King,
.       Eb       Bb/D      F  Eb
 Who delight to bring Him praise; ||
.    Bb               Eb   F    Gm
 Come all and tune your hearts to sing
.       Eb              Bb
 To the Morning Star of grace. ||
.         Eb               Bb/D
 From the shifting shadows of the earth
.          Eb      Bb/D    F   Eb
 We will lift our eyes to Him,||
.     Bb             Eb F  Gm
 Where steady arms of mercy reach
.    Eb              Bb
 To gather children in.
 
[C]
.     F        Eb      F                Eb
 Rejoice, Rejoice! Let every tongue rejoice!
.    F         Gm  F  Eb Bb/D  Cm          F       Bb
 One heart, one voice;        O Church of Christ, rejoice!
 
 
[V2]
 
.      Bb                  Eb     Bb/D
 Come, those whose joy is morning sun,
.           Eb       Bb/D       F    Eb
 And those weeping through the night;||
.       Bb               Eb   F   Gm
 Come, those who tell of battles won,
.           Eb                Bb
 And those struggling in the fight. ||
.         Eb               Bb/D
 For His perfect love will never change,
.         Eb     Bb/D   F   Eb
 And His mercies never cease,||
.     Bb                Eb  F   Gm
 But follow us through all our days
.           Eb              Bb
 With the certain hope of peace.
 
 
[V3]
.       Bb                  Eb   Bb/D
 Come, young and old from every land -
.        Eb   Bb/D     F    Eb
 Men and women of the faith;||
.       Bb                Eb  F   Gm
 Come, those with full or empty hands -
.           Eb           Bb
 Find the riches of His grace. ||
.      Eb                Bb/D
 Over all the world, His people sing -
.          Eb      Bb/D   F   Eb
 Shore to shore we hear them call||
.     Bb                      Eb  F  Gm
 The Truth that cries through every age:
.      Eb            Bb
 “Our God is all in all”!
