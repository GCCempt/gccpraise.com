 Grace unmeasured, vast and free
.D                 A     Bm
 That knew me from eternity
.     D              G
 That called me out before my birth
.   Bm        Em     A         G   Gmaj7  
 To bring You glory on this earth
.D              G
 Grace amazing, pure and deep
.      D           A   Bm
 That saw me in my misery
.      D                 G
 That took my curse and owned my blame
.  Em        G        A          D A/C#
 So I could bear your righteous name

.Bm      A/B    G
 Grace (grace, grace)

.Bm     A/B     G
 Grace (grace, grace)

 Clothes me with pow’r to do what is right

 Grace (grace, grace)

 Will lead me to heav’n where I’ll see Your face

 And never cease to thank you for Your grace

[2]
 Grace abounding, strong and true
 That makes me long to be like You
 That turns me from my selfish pride,
 To love the Cross on which You died (For me)
 
 Grace, undending, all my days
 You give me strength to run this race
 And when my years on Earth are through
 The praise will all belong to You
 
[E]
.     C2            G/B                D   Dsus   D   Dsus
 And never cease to thank you for Your grace
