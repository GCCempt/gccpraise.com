. C F A7 F

[V1]
.    F         C            F    G
 In Christ alone my hope is found
.C/E       F             G             C
 He is my light, my strength, my song||
.        F        C               F G
 This cornerstone, this solid ground
.C/E                    F           G         C
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm||
.         C/E          F              A7   G
 What heights of love, what depths of peace
.         C/E         F                 A7     G
 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease||
.      F      C             F G
 My comforter, my all in all
.C/E            F         G        C
 Here in the love of Christ I stand

. C F A7 F

[V2]
.         F        C             F G
 There in the ground His body lay
.C/E            F             G         C
 Light of the world by darkness slain ||
.          F           C           F G
 Then, bursting forth in glorious day
.C/E             F            G    C
 Up from the grave He rose again ||
.     C/E     F          A7 G
 And as He stands in victory
.        C/E          F       A7     G
 Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me||
.      F      C          F  G
 For I am His and He is mine
.C/E                   F           G     C
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ

.C F A7 F

[V3]
.      F         C          F      G
 No guilt in life, no fear in death
.C/E          F             G       C
 This is the power of Christ in me||
.         F             C        F    G
 From life’s first cry to final breath
.C/E        F               G C
 Jesus commands my destiny||
.      C/E       F          A7     G
 No power of hell, no scheme of man
.       C/E   F          A7       G
 Can ever pluck me from His hand||
.      F      C           F      G
 ‘Til He returns or calls me home
.C/E            F            G         C
 Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand

. C F A7 F

 ‘Til He returns or calls me home
