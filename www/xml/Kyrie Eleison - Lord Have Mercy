[C]
 Kyrie Eleison, have mercy
 Christ Eleison, have mercy;
 Kyrie Eleison, have mercy,
 Christ Eleison, have mercy.
 
[V1]
 As we come before You with the needs of our world,
 We confess our failures and our sin,||
 For our words are many yet our deeds have been few;
 Fan the fire of compassion once again.
 
[V2]
 When the cries of victims go unheard in the land,
 And the scars of war refuse to heal; ||
 Will we stand for justice to empower the weak
 Till their bonds of oppression are no more?
 
[V3]
 If we love our God with all our heart, mind and strength,
 And we love our neighbors as ourselves; ||
 Then this law of love will heal the nations of earth
 And the glory of Christ will be revealed.
 
[V4]
 Lord, renew our vision to be Christ where we live,
 To reach out in mercy to the lost; ||
 For each cup of kindness to the least in our midst
 Is an offering of worship to the throne.
 
;the last chorus should be quiet and prayerful
