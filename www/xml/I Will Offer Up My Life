[V1]
.G      G/B         C
 I will offer up my life
.   D               G
 In spirit and truth,
.        G/B            C
 Pouring out the oil of love
.      D              G
 As my worship to You ||
.   G/B              C       D          G
 In surrender I must give my every part;
.      G/B              C
 Lord, receive the sacrifice
.     D           G 
 Of a broken heart

[C]
.                  C     D          G
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
.                 C             D        G
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
.                    C     D           G
 Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
.                    C
 As a praise of Your name
.        D               G
 For the things You have done?||
.                      Am    G/B         C   G
 Oh my words could not tell, not even in part
.       Am      G/B          C
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.  D                G
 By this thankful heart
---
[V2]
.G      G/B         C
 You deserve my every breath
.   D               G
 For You've paid the great cost;
.        G/B            C
 Giving up Your life to death,
.      D              G
 Even death on a cross ||
.   G/B              C              D          G
 You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
.      G/B              C
 Opened up the gates of heaven
.         D           G
 And have beckoned me in


[C2]
.                  C     D          G
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
.                 C             D        G
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
.                    C     D           G
 Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
.                    C
 As a praise of Your name
.        D               G
 For the things You have done?

[E]
.                      Am    G/B         C   G
 Oh my words could not tell, not even in part
.       Am      G/B          C
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.       Am      G/B          C
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.       Am      G/B          C
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.  D                G
