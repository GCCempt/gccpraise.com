  <lyrics>[V1]
 Away in a manger,
 No crib for His bed
 The little Lord Jesus
 Laid down His sweet head
 ||
 The stars in the sky
 Looked down where He lay
 The little Lord Jesus
 Asleep on the hay
 
[V2]
 The cattle are lowing
 The poor Baby wakes
 But little Lord Jesus
 No crying He makes
 ||
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus
 Look down from the sky
 And stay by my cradle,
 'Til morning is nigh.
 
[V3]
 Be near me, Lord Jesus,
 I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever
 And love me I pray
 ||
 Bless all the dear children
 In Thy tender care
 And fit us for heaven
 To live with Thee there</lyrics></song>
