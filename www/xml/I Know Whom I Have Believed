  <title>I Know Whom I Have Believed</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.   C                  F/C   C 
 I know not why God's won-drous grace
.   C                G
 To me He hath made known ||
.     C            F/C    C 
 Nor why unworthy Christ in love
.    G7               C
 Redeemed me for His own


[C]
.       F                  C
 But I know whom I have believed
.           G                  C
 And am persuaded that He is able ||
.    F                        C
 To keep that which I've committed
.      G7                C
 Unto Him against that day


[V2]
.   C                F/C  C 
 I know not how this sav-ing faith
.   C             G
 To me He did impart ||
.     C           F/C  C 
 Nor how believing in His word
.          G7              C
 Wrought peace within my heart


[V3]
.   C               F/C  C 
 I know not how the Spir-it moves
.   C               G
 Convincing men of sin ||
.     C            F/C    C 
 Revealing Jesus through the Word
.    G7              C
 Cre-ating faith in Him


[V4]
.   C               F/C   C 
 I know not what of good or ill
.    C                G
 May be reserved for me ||
.     C           F/C  C 
 Of weary ways or gold-en days
.   G7              C
 Before His face I see


[V5]
.   C               F/C   C 
 I know not when my Lord may come
.    C                 G
 At night or noonday fair ||
.     C               F/C   C 
 Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him
.    G7              C
 Or meet Him in the air
