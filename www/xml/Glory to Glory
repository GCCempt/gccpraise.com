  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm         G    D
 Created from dust
.Bm      G         D
 You came and You lived among us
.Bm         G       D
 You took on our frame
.                Bm
 You walked in our pain
.        G                 D
 And now You’re taking us higher

.Bm         G      D
 You stepped into time
.Bm      G                       D
 You laid down Your life to save us
.Bm        G                  D
 You took all our shame
.                            Bm
 On the cross it was laid
.        G                 D
 And now You’re taking us higher


[C1] 
.Dsus       Bm       G        D
 We go from glory to glory to glory

 We’ll never be the same
.G               D
 We’ll never be the same
.Dsus       Bm       G        D
 We go from glory to glory to glory

 Forever changed


[V2]
.Bm        G        D
 You call me Your friend
.Bm              G               D
 Brought into Your endless kingdom
.Bm           G       D
 By the blood I was made
.                Bm
 No longer a slave
.          G                 D
 And now You’re taking us higher


[B]
.G
 Until we reach that day
.D
 Love conquers everything
.A                             Bm      A
 We’ll cry an anthem singing Holy, Holy
.G
 And when we see that day
.D
 We’re standing face to face
.A                               Bm       A
 We’ll shout an anthem singing Holy, Holy


[V3]
.Bm      G       D
 You took on the grave
.Bm      G               D
 So not even death can shake us
.Bm        G      D
 The Victor has won
.                Bm
 And Heaven has come
.           G                D
 And now You’re taking us higher
.Bm           G                D
 And now You’re taking us higher

[C2]

      ‘cause we go from glory to glory to glory
.    Dsus                   Bm          G            D 
       we’ll never be the same, we’ll never be the same
.    Dsus            Bm          G          D 
       You take us higher and higher and higher
