  <title>Above the Hills of Time</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.          A                           D
 Above the hills of time the cross is gleaming  
.            A                            Esus  E7
 Fair as the sun when night has turned to day ||
.             A                           D
 And from it love’s pure light is richly streaming 
.               A          E7          A
 To cleanse the heart and banish sin away ||
.              A        D                Amaj7
 To this dear cross the eyes of men are turning 
.         F#m    D            Esus  E7
 Today as in the ages lost to sight ||
.            A        D                       Amaj7
 And so for Thee, O Christ, Men’s hearts are yearning
.                A               D     E7   A
 As shipwrecked seamen yearn for morn-ing light
 
  
[V2]
.              A                           D
 The cross, O Christ, Thy wondrous love revealing
.            A                          Esus  E7
 Awakes our hearts as with the light of morn ||
.            A                        D
 And pardon o’er our sinful spirits stealing 
.               A          E7            A
 Tells us that we, In Thee, have been reborn ||
.            A         D                 Amaj7
 Like echoes to sweet temple bells replying
.              F#m        D             Esus  E7
 Our hearts, O Lord, make answer to Thy love ||
.             A         D             Amaj7
 And we will love Thee with a love undy-ing
.              A              D   E7   A
 Till we are gathered to Thy home a-bove
 
 
[E]
.            A         D                 Amaj7
 Like echoes to sweet temple bells replying
.              F#m        D             Esus  E7
 Our hearts, O Lord, make answer to Thy love ||
.             A         D             Amaj7
 And we will love Thee with a love undy-ing
.              F#/A           D   E7   A
 Till we are gathered to Thy home a-bove
