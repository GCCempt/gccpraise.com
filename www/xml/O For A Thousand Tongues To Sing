  <lyrics>[V1]
. D G    D        G          Em
 O for a thousand tongues to sing
.D   G        D7 G     D
 My great Redeemer's praise, ||
.    G             C 
 The glories of my God and King,
.     G/D        D7   G
 The triumphs of His grace!
 
[V2]
. D G    D        G          Em
 My gracious Master and my God,
.D   G        D7 G     D
 Assist me to proclaim, ||
.    G             C 
 To spread through all the earth abroad,
.     G/D        D7   G
 The honours of Thy name.
 
[V3]
. D G    D        G          Em
 Jesus, the name that charms our fears,
.D   G        D7 G     D
 That bids our sorrows cease; ||
.    G             C 
 'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
.     G/D        D7   G
 'Tis life, and health, and peace.
 
[V4]
. D G    D        G          Em
 He breaks the pow'r of reigning sin,
.D   G        D7 G     D
 He sets the pris-'ner free; ||
--- 
.    G             C 
 His blood can make the foulest clean,
.     G/D        D7   G
 His blood availed for me.
 
[V5]
. D G    D        G          Em
 He speaks and, list'ning to His voice,
.D   G        D7 G     D
 New life the dead receive; ||
.    G             C 
 The mournful, broken hearts rejoice;
.     G/D        D7   G
 The humble poor believe.
 
[V6]
. D G    D        G          Em
 Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb
.D   G        D7 G     D
 Your loosened tongues employ, ||
.    G             C 
 Ye blind, behold your Saviour come,
.     G/D        D7   G
 And leap, ye lame, for joy!</lyrics>
