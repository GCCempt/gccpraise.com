.      G       C        G            G             D
 How   firm    a foun___dation, you   saints of the Lord,
.    G      C        G     Em          G/D   D7        G
 Is  laid   for your faith in His      ex____cellent   word!||
.     G                Em             G             D
 What more can He      say than to    you He hath   said,
.     G     C       G     Em       G/D  D7       G
 To   you   who for re____fuge to  Je___sus hath fled?

[V2]
 "Fear not,    I am     with you, O be not dis____mayed,
 For I      am your  God,  and will    still give you aid; ||
 I'll strengthen you, help you and  cause you to stand,
 Up___held  by My   right_eous, om_ni___potent   hand."

[V3]
 "When through the deep waters I     call you to  go,
 The ri_____vers of  sor___row shall   not   over______flow;||
 For I will be         with you, your troubles to   bless,
 And  sanc__tify    to    you your deep_est   distress."

[V4]
 "When through fiery    trials your   pathway shall lie,
 My  grace, all suf__fi____cient, shall be    your sup___ply; ||
 The flame shall not   hurt you; I   only de_______sign,
 your  dross to con__sume, and your  gold to re____fine."

[V5]
 "E'en down to old age all my people shall prove
 my sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;||
 and when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,
 like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.

[V6]
 "The  soul    that on  Jesus has   leaned for re_pose,
 I   will   not, I   will  not de______sert  to his    foes;||
 That soul, though all hell should en_deavor to     shake,
 I'll ne____ver, no ne____ver, no  ne___ver for__sake!"
