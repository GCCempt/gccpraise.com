  <lyrics>[V1]
.    F                  A#
 It's not just about the manger
.C             A#
 Where the baby lay
.    F                 A#
 It's not all about the angels
.    C
 Who sang for him that day ||
.    F                  A#
 It's not just about the shepherds
.        Am                    Dm
 Or the bright and shining star
.    A#                F
 It's not all about the wisemen
.    A#               Csus C
 Who travelled from afar
 
[C1]
.              F
 It's about the cross
.             C
 It's about my sin
.              A#            F
 It's about how Jesus came to be born once
.       Gm                 C
 So that we could be born again ||
.              F
 It's about the stone
.               Dm
 That was rolled away
.       A#               F                  A# C
 So that you and I could have real life some d_ay ||
.                 F A# C A#
 It's about the cross
.         F        A# C
 It's about the cross
---
[V2]
.    F                  A#
 It's not just about the presents
.C             A#
 Underneath the tree
.    F                 A#
 It's not all about the feeling
.    C
 That the season brings to me ||
.    F                  A#
 It's not just about coming home
.        Am               Dm
 To be with those you love
.    A#                F
 It's not all about the beauty
.    A#               Csus C
 In the snow I'm dreaming of
 
[C2]
.              F
 It's about the cross (Its's about the cross)
.             C
 It's about my sin (It's about my sin)
.              A#            F
 It's about how Jesus came to be born once
.       Gm                 C
 So that we could be born again ||
.              F
 It's about the stone (It's about the stone)
.               Dm
 That was rolled away (rolled away)
.       A#               F                  A# C
 So that you and I could have real life some d_ay
.                 F A# C A#
 It's about the cross
 
[B]
.      D#            A#                     F
 The beginning of the story is wonderful and great
.            D#              A#                  C             D
 But it's the ending that can save you and that's why we celebrate ||
.              G
 It's about the cross
.              D
 It's about my sin
.              C             G
 It's about how Jesus came to be born once
.       Am                  D
 So that we could be born again ||
.                G
 It's about God's love
.           Em
 Nailed to a tree
.          C             G                      AM  A
 It's about every drop of blood that flowed from Him
.                        D
 when it should have been me ||
.              G
 It's about the stone
.               Em
 That was rolled away
.       C               G                  Am D
 So that you and I could have real life some day
.       C               G                  Am D
 So that you and I could have real life some day ||
.              G  C D C
 It's about the cross
.        G         C D C G
 It's about the cross</lyrics>
