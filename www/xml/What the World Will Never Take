[V1] 
.A 
 With all I'm holding inside 
.                        D 
 With all my hopes and desires 
..D 
 And all the dreams that I've dreamt  
 
[V2]
.A 
 With all I'm hoping to be 
.                            D 
 And all that the world will bring 
.                          Dmaj9 
 And all that fails to compare 
 
 
[P] 
.    F#m          B5     Dmaj9 
 You say You want all of me 
.           A          B5 
 I wouldn't have it any other way 
 
[B] 
.A 
 I've got a Saviour and He's living in me 
.D            F#m Bsus4      D 
 Whoa I wanna know  I wanna know You today ||
. A 
 And You're the best thing that has happened to me 
.        F#m 
 And the world will never take 
.    Bsus4             D         A 
 The world will never take You away

[E] 
.A                  D        A 
 No one could ever take You away 
.                   D        A 
 No one could ever take You away </lyrics></song>
