 In Christ alone my hope is found

 He is my light, my strength, my song ||
.       G     D         G          A
 This Cornerstone, this solid ground
.D/F#             G    D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm ||
.     D/F#       G          D/F#      Asus A
 What heights of love, what depths of peace

 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease ||
.     G    D      G       A
 My Comforter, my All in All

 In Christ alone, who took on flesh

 This gift of love and righteousness

 Scorned by the ones He came to save ||

 ‘Til on that cross as Jesus died
.     D/F#      G             Bm7 Asus A
 The wrath of God was satisfied ||
.     G    D      G       A
 For every sin on Him was laid
.D/F#        G    D/F# Em7 G/A  D
 Here in the death of Christ I live

[V3]
.   G        D      G           A
 There in the ground His body lay
.D/F#      G     D/F#   Em7  G/A   D
 Light of the world by darkness slain ||
.       G     D         G          A
 Then bursting forth in glorious Day
.D/F#             G    D/F#   Em7  G/A D
 Up from the grave He rose again ||
.     D/F#       G          D/F# Asus A
 And as He stands in victory

 Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me ||
.     G    D      G       A
 For I am His and He is mine
.D/F#        G    D/F# Em7 G/A  D
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ
