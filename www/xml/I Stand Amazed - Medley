  <title>I Stand Amazed - Medley</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.G
 I stand amazed in the presence
.D           C      G
 Of Jesus the Nazarene,
.C                      G
 And wonder how He could love me,
.          D         G
 A sinner, condemned, unclean.

[C1]
.G
 How marvelous! How wonderful!
.D
 And my song shall ever be,
.G        D/F# Em7
 How marvelous! How wonderful!
.Am    Em7     D       G
 Is my Saviorâ€™s love for me!

;Instrumental
. G C  Em7 G

[V2]
.G
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
.D           C      G
 He made them His very own;
.C                      G
 He bore the burden to Calvary,
.          D         G
 And suffered and died alone.


[V3]
.G
 When with the ransomed in glory
.D           C      G
 His face I at last shall see,
.C                      G
 It will be my joy through the ages
.          D         G
 To sing of His love for me.


[C2]
.G                    D/F#
 How great is our God, sing with me,
.Em7                  D/F#
 How great is our God, all will see,
.C        D                G
 How great, how great is our God.

[B1]
.G           D/F#
 Name above all names,
.Em7        D/F#
 Worthy of all praise,
.C
 My heart will sing
.D                 G
 How great is our God.
