  <lyrics>;INTRO: D
[V1]
.                         Bm      G
 There is hurt, there is trouble
.                         D 
 There are tears on the ground
.                       Bm      G
 From the ash and the rubble
.                        D
 There's a cry ringing out ||
.                       A
 You've been shaken by loss
.                           Bm
 You've been shattered by fear
.                       Bm      G
 Give me eyes that can see it
.                       D
 Give me ears that can hear ||
.                    Bm       G
 When you hurt I am hurting
.                          D
 When you are bleeding, I bleed
.                    Bm
 When you cry, I am crying
.                  D
 I am down on my knees ||
.                             A
 When there is nothing left standing
.                        Bm
 And there is no reason why
.           G             D
 Let's go walk along the water
.         G               A7
 Till we reach the other side
 
[C]
.    D         Bm
 Stretch your arms 
.      G              A
 and help the broken hearted
. D     Bm                       A
 Say a prayer that change will come ||
. D       G
 We will fight 
.                           Bm
 for the children who are hurting
.       G      
 Let's stand as one 
.     A             D   Eb
 and come together now
 
[V2]
.                     Cm        G#
 Be the light in the darkness
.                     Eb
 Be the peace in the storm
.                   Cm
 Be a shelter for someone
.                         Eb
 When the rain starts to pour ||
.                         Bb
 Be the hands that bring healing
.                    Cm
 And the hands that provide
.          G#             Eb
 Let's go walk along the water
.         G3              Bb7
 Till we reach the other side
 
 
[B]
.             Bb
 It won't be long, 
.             Cm
 Keep holding on now
. G#             Eb
 Hold your head high
.                Bb
 Hold your head high ||
.            Bb
 Keep standing strong
.            Cm
 You're not alone now
. G#             Eb
 Hold your head high
.                Bb   C7
 Hold your head high
 
 
[O]
.       Bb 
 Let's stand as one
.     C7              F
 And come together - now
 
[C2]
.    F         Dm
 Stretch your arms 
.      Bb              C7
 and help the broken hearted
. F     Bb                       C7
 Say a prayer that change will come ||
. F       Bb
 We will fight 
.                           Dm
 for the children who are hurting
.       Bb    
 Let's stand as one 
.     C7             F
 and come together now
