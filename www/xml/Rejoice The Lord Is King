  <lyrics>[V1]
.   C         G/B     Am
 Rejoice the Lord is King
.      F        Dm    G
 Your Lord and King adore ||
.   C            Am   G/B   D
 Rejoice, give thanks and sing
.     G/B  C  G/D  D  G
 and tri-umph ev-er-more
 
 
[C]

 Rejoice, a-gain I say rejoice.
 
 
[V2]
.   C        G/B     Am
 Jesus the Savior reigns
.     F      Dm         G
 The God of truth and love ||
.      C       Am   G/B   D
 When He had purged our stains
.    G/B  C  G/D   D  G
 He took His seat a-bove
 
 
[V3]
.      C      G/B     Am
 His Kingdom cannot fail
.      F        Dm        G
 He rules o'er earth and heav'n ||

 The keys of death and hell
.    G/B  C  G/D D   G
 Are to our Je-sus giv'n
 
 
[V4]
.    C       G/B          Am
 He sits at God's right hand
.      F        Dm    G
 till all his foes submit, ||
.     C      Am  G/B  D
 and bow to his com-mand,
.     G/B  C  G/D   D   G
 and fall be-neath his feet.
 
 
[V5]
.    C        G/B     Am
 Rejoice in glorious hope!
.      F        Dm         G
 Our Lord the Judge shall come ||
.     C        Am  G/B   D
 And take His ser-vants up
.    G/B  C  G/D  D   G
 To their e-ter-nal home
