  <lyrics>[V]
 If you gotta start somewhere why not here
 If you gotta start sometime why not now
 If we gotta start somewhere I say here
 If we gotta start sometime I say now||
 Through the fog there is hope in the distance
 From cathedrals to third world missions
 Love will fall to the earth like a crashing wave
 
[C]
 Tonight's the night
 For the sinners and the saints
 Two worlds collide in a beautiful display
 It's all love tonight||
 When we step across the line
 We can sail across the sea
 To a city with one king
 A city on our knees
 A city on our knees.
 
[C2]
 Tonight's the night
 For the sinners and the saints
 Two worlds collide
 In a glorious display||
 Cause its all love tonight
 When we step across the line
 We can sail across the sea
 To a city with one king||
 A city on our knees
 A city on our knees
 A city on our knees
 A city on our knees
 
 
[B]
 Tonight could last forever
 We are one choice from together
 Tonight couldn't last forever
 Ooh||
 Tonight could last forever
 We are one choice from together
 As family
 We're family||
 Oh Tonight could last forever
 We are one choice from together
 You and me
 Yeah, you and me
 
[T]
 If we gotta start somewhere why not here
 If we gotta start sometime why not now
