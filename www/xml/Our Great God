  <lyrics>[V1]
.C               G           F             C
 Eternal God, unchanging, mysterious and unknown
.      C                G            F              C
 Your boundless love unfailing, in grace and mercy shown||
.     Am             F                Am                    F
 Bright Seraphim in ceaseless flight around Your glorious throne
.     C                  G                 F            C
 They raise their voices day and night in praise to You alone
 
[C]
.     C    G       F               C
 Hallelujah, Glory be to our great God
.    C     G        F              C
 Hallelujah, Glory be to our great God
 
 
[V2]
.      C                G         F            C
 Lord, we are weak and frail, helpless in the storm
.   C                  G       F               C
 Surround us with Your angels, hold us in Your arms||
.       Am                  F           Am            F
 Our cold and ruthless enemy, his pleasure is our harm
.      C             G              F                  C
 Rise up O Lord, and he will flee before our sovereign God
 
[V3]
.     C             G               F            C
 Let every creature in the sea and every flying bird
.    C                G               F              C
 Let every mountain, every field and valley of the earth||
.    Am                 F               Am           F
 Let all the moons and all the stars in all the universe
.        C            G              F                 C
 Sing praises to the living God who rules them by His Word</lyrics>
