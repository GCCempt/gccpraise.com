  <lyrics>[V1] 
. A
 In Christ alone will I glory
.          Esus4      D       F#m
 Though I could pride myself in battles won
. 	        A
 For I’ve been blessed beyond measure
. 	Esus4	         D	    	        E
 And by His strength alone I’ll overcome ||
. D			  A    	           
 Oh, I could stop and count successes 
.     Esus4  	         D
 like diamonds in my hands
. A	          D	                       
 But those trophies could not equal 
.       E
 to the grace by which I stand
 
[C1]
. D         A
 In Christ alone I place my trust
.   	      Esus4	          E	     A
 And find my glory in the power of the cross
. 	D	        Esus4            F#m
 In every victory let it be said of me
.       D               E
 My source of strength, My source of hope
. 	    A
 Is Christ alone
 
--- 
[V2] 
 In Christ alone do I glory
 For only by His grace I am redeemed
 For only His tender mercy
 Could reach beyond my weakness to my need ||
 And now I seek no greater honor than just to know Him more
 And to count my gains but losses to the glory of my Lord
 
[C2]
. D        A
 In Christ alone I place my trust
.          Esus4	          E        A
 And find my glory in the power of the cross
. 	D	        Esus4            F#m
 In every victory let it be said of me
.       D                  	E
 My source of strength, My source of hope
 
[E]
. 	E            B
 In Christ alone I place my trust
.   	      F#sus4	          F#       B
 And find my glory in the power of the cross
. 	E	        F#sus4            B
 In every victory let it be said of me
.       E                          F#
 My source of strength, My source of hope
. 	    B
 Is Christ alone  </lyrics></song>
