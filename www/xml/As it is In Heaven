[V1]
.E                  
 Whether now or then
.E/G#                
 Death is not my end
.A                         C#m 
 I know heaven waits for me
.E                         
 Though the road seems long
.E/G#                  
 I'll never walk alone
.A                       C#m 
 I got all I need to sing


[P1]
.           A      
 I know You love me
.           E/G#      
 I know You found me
.           C#m     
 I know You saved me
.                              E/G#  
 And Your grace will never fail
.                A    
 And while I'm waiting
.          B    
 I'm not waiting
.                         E 
 I know heaven lives in me


[V2]
.E                   
 Should I suffer long
.E/G#                 
 This is not my home
.A                         C#m 
 I know heaven waits for me
.E                       
 Though the night is dark
.E/G#                  
 Heaven owns my heart
.A                           C#m 
 And I got all I need to sing


[C]
.          A                     
 So I will sing like I will there
.         E                    
 In the fearless light of glory
.          C#m                    
 Where the darkness cannot find me
.         E                
 And Your face is all I see
.       A              
 I will sing like a man
.          E/G#               
 With no sickness in my body
.        C#m                     
 Like no prison walls can hold me
.       E                  
 I will sing like I am free
