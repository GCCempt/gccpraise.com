  <lyrics>[V1]
 I lay my life down at Your feet
 Cause You're the only one I need
 I turn to You and You are always there ||
 In troubled times it's You I seek
 I put You first that's all I need
 I humble all I am all to You
 
[C]
 One way, Jesus
 You're the only one that I could live for
 One Way, Jesus
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 
 
[V2]
 You are always, always there
 Every how and everywhere
 Your grace abounds so deeply within me||
 You will never ever change
 Yesterday today the same
 Forever till forever meets no end
 
 
[B]
 You are the way the truth and the life
 We live by faith and not by sight for You
 We're living all for You</lyrics></song>
