 Jesus your blood and righteousness
 That’s what my soul really needs
 ||
 Jesus your blood and righteousness
 That’s what my soul really needs
 ||
 Your precious blood to cleanse me
 To wash me from all my iniquity
 Your precious blood covers me
 Gives victory over the enemy
 ||
 Sets my soul free from your fury
 Gives freedom from reigning impurity
 Now I can serve you without fear
 Cause Jesus your blood has brought me near
 ||
 Jesus your blood and righteousness
 That’s what my soul really needs
 ||
 Jesus your blood and righteousness
 That’s what my soul really needs
 ||
 Your righteousness to clothe me
 Presents me without blame before Thee
 When Satan stands to accuse me
 Christ Jesus will stand and excuse me
 ||
 Your perfect righteousness
 My soul’s wedding dress when I’m laid to rest
 ||
 Then I’ll ascend the Lord’s hill
 Then I’ll stand in your holy place
 I’ll see you Christ Jesus face to face
 ||
 You deliver from all disgrace
 You will plead my case
 Cause Jesus you are my righteousness
 ||
 Jesus your blood and righteousness
 That’s what my soul really needs
 ||
 Jesus your blood and righteousness
 That’s what my soul really needs</lyrics></song>
