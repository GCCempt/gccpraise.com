  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm                           A      D
  Skies spin their dance within Your breath
.Em - Bm                       A      G
       Time runs its race within Your hand
.Em - Bm                         A      D
       And my mind runs wild to compre - hend
.Em - Bm                            A     G
       What no mind on earth could under - stand


[P1]
.Bm                     A
  Your ways are high - er
.D                        Em
 Your thoughts are wilder
.Bm                     A   
  Love came like mad - ness
.D                         D/F#   
 Poured out in blood-wash romance
.G                      A      Bm     
 It makes no sense but this is  grace
.Em - D                                Asus      A           
      And I know You're with me in this  place


[C1]
.    G
 Here now
.A                                 Bm
 All I know is I know that You are here now
.D/F#
 Still my heart
.                       G
 Let Your voice be all I hear now
.A                           
 Spirit breathe like the wind
.             Bm    D 
 Come have Your way
.                     Em    Bm      
 'Cause I know You're in this place

.Bm                      A         D           
  Faith makes a fool of what makes sense
.Em - Bm                               A    G
       But grace found my heart where logic ends
.Em - Bm                        A     D      
       When justice called for all my debts
.Em - Bm                      A       G 
       The Friend of sinners came in - stead
