[V1]
. Bm           A      D
 If I saw You on the street
. G                        D      A
   And You said come and follow me
. Bm                     A    D
  But I had to give up everything
. G                        D         A 
 All I once held dear and all of my dreams
 
[P1]
. D                  A
 Would I love You enough to let go
. Bm                     G
  Or would my love run dry
.                      A
 When You asked for my life.
 
[C]
. D                  A
   When did love become unmoving?
. Bm                 G
   When did love become unconsuming?
. D                      A
   Forgetting what the world has told me
. Bm           G
   Father of love, You can have me
. A
    You can have me
---  
[V2]
. Bm                   A        D
   If You're all You claim to be
. G                      D  A
   Then I'm not losing anything
. Bm                 A       D
   So I will crawl upon my knees
. G                          D    A
   Just to know the joy of suffering
 
 
[P2]
. D                  A
  I will love You enough to let go
. Bm                    G
  Lord, I give you my life
.              A
 I give you my life
 
 
[B]
. D                      A
 I want to be where You are
. Bm                    A
 I'm running into Your arms
. D                     A
 And I will never look back
. Bm                   A
 So Jesus, here is my heart
 
[E]
. Bm               G
   My Father, My love,
. A   
    You can have me
