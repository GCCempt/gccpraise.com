  <lyrics>[V1]
. G       D   G    C   D  G
 As with gladness men of old
. C       G   C    G   D  G
 Did the guiding star behold;
. G       D    G   C     D    G
 As with joy they hailed its light,
. C      G  C     G   D    G
 Leading onward, beaming bright;||
. G   D     Em      D         G
 So, most gracious Lord, may we
. C D  G   Am  G  D    G
 Evermore be led to thee.
 
[V2]
 As with joyful steps they sped
 To that lowly manger bed,
 There to bend the knee before
 Him whom heaven and earth adore; ||
 So may we with willing feet
 Ever seek thy mercy seat.
 
[V3]
 As they offered gifts most rare
 At the manger rude and bare;
 So may we with holy joy,
 Pure, and free from sin's alloy, ||
 All our costliest treasures bring,
 Christ, to thee, our heavenly King.
 
[V4]
 Holy Jesus, every day
 Keep us in the narrow way;
 And, when earthly things are past,
 Bring our ransomed souls at last ||
 Where they need no star to guide,
 Where no clouds thy glory hide.</lyrics></song>
