  <lyrics>[V1]
 O Jesus, I have promised 
 to serve thee to the end; 
 be thou forever near me, 
 my Master and my friend. 
 ||
 I shall not fear the battle 
 if thou art by my side, 
 nor wander from the pathway 
 if thou wilt be my guide. 
 
[V2]
 O let me feel thee near me! 
 The world is ever near; 
 I see the sights that dazzle, 
 the tempting sounds I hear; 
 ||
 my foes are ever near me, 
 around me and within; 
 but Jesus, draw thou nearer, 
 and shield my soul from sin. 
 
[V3]
 O Jesus, thou hast promised 
 to all who follow thee 
 that where thou art in glory 
 there shall thy servant be. 
 ||
 And, Jesus, I have promised 
 to serve thee to the end; 
 O give me grace to follow, 
 my Master and my Friend.</lyrics></song>
