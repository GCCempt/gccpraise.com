  <lyrics>[V1]
.D           A/D      G          D/F#
 See, what a morning, gloriously bright
.A        Bm  G      D/F# G    D/A  A
 with the dawning of hope in Jerusalem
.D           A/D            G                 D
 folded the grave clothes, tomb filled with light
.A/C#   Bm  G     D/F#   G        D/A  A  A7/G
 as the angels announce Christ is risen!||
.            A/G  G  D/F#     G       D/F#
 See God's salvation plan, wrought in love,
.  G      D/F#   G      D/A   A   A/G  D/F#
 borne in pain, paid in sacrifice,
.             A/G     G   D/F#
 fulfilled in Christ, the Man,
.G      D/F#   G       D/A     A       D   A/D
 for He lives: Christ is risen from the dead
 
[V2]
.D           A/D      G          D/F#
 See Mary weeping, "Where is he Laid"?
.A        Bm  G      D/F# G    D/A  A
 As in sorrow she turns from the empty tomb;
.D           A/D            G                 D
 Hears a voice speaking, calling her name;
.A/C#   Bm  G     D/F#   G        D/A  A  A7/G
 It's the Master, the Lord raised to life again!||
.            A/G  G  D/F#     G       D/F#
 The voice that spans the years,
.  G      D/F#   G      D/A   A   A/G  D/F#
 Speaking life, stirring hope, bringing peace to us,
.             A/G     G   D/F#
 Will sound till he appears,
.G      D/F#   G       D/A     A       D   A/D
 For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!

[V3]
.D           A/D      G          D/F#
 One with the Father, Ancient of Days,
.A        Bm  G      D/F# G    D/A  A
 Through the Spirit who clothes faith with certainty
.D           A/D            G                 D
 Honour and blessing, glory and praise
.A/C#   Bm  G     D/F#   G        D/A  A  A7/G
 To the King crowned with power and authority!||
.            A/G  G  D/F#     G       D/F#
 And we are raised with Him,
.  G      D/F#   G      D/A   A   A/G  D/F#
 Death is dead, love has won, Christ has conquered;
.             A/G     G   D/F#
 And we shall reign with Him
.G      D/F#   G       D/A     A       D   A/D
 For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!
 
[E]
.            A/G  G  D/F#     G       D/F#
 And we are raised with Him,
.  G      D/F#   G      D/A   A   A/G  D/F#
 Death is dead, love has won, Christ has conquered;
.             A/G     G   D/F#
 And we shall reign with Him
.G      D/F#   G       D/A     A       D   A/D
 For He lives, Christ is risen from the dead!
