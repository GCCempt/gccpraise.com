.G
 Don't know where to begin
.Em
 It's like my world's caving in
.C2                 Em               C2
 And I tried but I can't control my fear
.                    G
 Where do I go from here||
 
.G
 Sometimes it's so hard to pray
.Em
 You feel so far away
.C2               Em                  C2
 I am willing to go where You want me to
 God I trust You 
 
[C]
.Em                C2
 There's a raging sea
.                   G
 Right in front of me
.                 D/F#
 Wants to pull me in
.                Em
 Bring me to my knees ||
.                   C2
 So let the waters rise
.                 G
 If you want them to
.               D/F#
 I will follow You
. 	 	   Em     C2
 I will follow You
.               G      D/F#
 I will follow You
--- 
[V2]
.G
 I will swim in the deep
.Em
 Cuz You'll be next to me
.C2                        Em                        C2
 You're in the eye of the storm and the calm of the sea
.                      G
 You're never out of reach||
.G
 God You know where I've been
.Em
 You were there with me then
.C2                  Em
 You were faithful before
.                     C2
 You'll be faithful again
 
 I'm holding Your hand
 
[B]
.Em                 C2
 God Your love is enough
.                     G
 You will pull me through
.             D/F#
 I'm holding on to You||
.Em                  C2
 God your love is enough
. 	         G
 I will follow You
.               D/F#
 I will follow You
