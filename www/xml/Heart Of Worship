.D A/C# G/E A
 
[V1]
. D                  A
 When the music fades
.                   G
 All is stripped away
.               Asus A
 And I simply come ||
. D                   A             G
 Longing just to bring something that's of worth
.                      Asus A
 That will bless Your heart
 
[P]
. Em             D/F#           A
 I'll bring You more than a song
.                    Em
 For a song in itself
.            D/F#            A
 Is not what you have required ||
. Em              D         A
 You search much deeper within
.                             Em
 Through the way things appear
.               D/F#        A
 You're looking into my heart
[C]
.      D                        A
      I'm coming back to the heart of worship
.               Em
      And it's all about You
.           G           A
      It's all about you, Jesus ||
.      D                          A
      I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
.                Em
      When it's all about You
.           G          A
      It's all about you, Jesus

[V2]
. D                  A
 King of endless worth
.               G
 No one could express
.                 Asus A
 How much You deserve ||
. D                     A
 Though I'm weak and poor
.               G
 All I have is Yours
.               Asus A
 Every single breath</lyrics>
