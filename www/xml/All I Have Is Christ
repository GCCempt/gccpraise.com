  <lyrics>[V1]
.C          G                Am                   
 I once was lost in darkest night, 
.               F       Am
 Yet thought I knew the way.||
.              Dm               F              
 The sin that promised joy and life, 
.           G      C
 Had led me to the grave.||
.         C/E                 F          
 I had no hope that You would own, 
.        Dm       Am
 A rebel to Your will.||
.           C/E               F            
 And if You had not loved me first, 
.           Am       G
 I would refuse You still.
 
[V2]
.C          G                Am                   
 But as I ran my hell-bound race, 
.               F       Am
 Indifferent to the cost ||
.             Dm               F              
 You looked upon my helpless state, 
.           G      C
 And led me to the cross.||
.         C/E                 F          
 And I beheld God’s love displayed, 
.             Dm     Am
 You suffered in my place ||
.             C/E                F            
 You bore the wrath reserved for me,
.           Am       G
 Now all I know is grace.
 
[C]
. C       F    C          G       Am
 Hal-le - lu - jah! All I have is Christ
.         F    Am         G     C
 Hal-le - lu - jah! Jesus is my life
 
[V3]
.C          G                Am                   
 Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone 
.               F       Am
 And live so all might see ||
.                 Dm             F              
 The strength to follow Your commands 
.             G        C
 Could never come from me.||
.           C/E              F          
 Oh Father, use my ransomed life 
.        Dm       Am
 In any way You choose.||
.           C/E         F            
 And let my song forever be 
.           Am       G
 My only boast is You.
