;Intro
;G  Cadd9  D 2x
 
[V1]
.G                                Cadd9 G
 I need to just admit my faith is paperthin
.                      Cadd9      D
 I'm feeling so burned out on religion ||
.G                              Cadd9  G
 I say an empty prayer I sing a tired song
.                 Cadd9          D           Am7
 I need to just admit that the passion's gone
 
 
[P1]
.      C              D
 And I want to get it back
 
 
[C]
.Em      Cadd9    G               D
    You told me look for You and I will find
.Em         Cadd9         G                 D
    So I'm here like I'm searching for the first time ||
.Em    Cadd9    G               D          Am7
    Revive me, Jesus make this cold heart start to move
.  C            D          ( Em  Cadd9  G  D  2x ) 
;*Help me rediscover You
 
;For bridge hold G
;*For outro hold C
 
[V2]
.G                                    Cadd9 G
 I want to learn to pray the way that David prayed
.                  Cadd9       D         G
 I want my soul to burn when I hear Your name ||
.                    Cadd9         D          G
 I want to feel like new I want to hunger for You
.                 Cadd9          D       Am7
 Bring me back to life like only You can do
 
 
[P2]
.              C                D
 Cause I don't want to stay the same
 
 
[B]
.       D/F#             Em    
 Lord I want to be Yours today
.          D/F#              Cadd9
 I want to know the passions of the Saints
.        Am7                  Em  Cadd9  G  D  2x
 And how they were changed
 
 
[O]
.C            Am7            C
   I want to burn for you
.         Am7
 Bring me back to life
.      C           D      G
 Jesus help me rediscover You</lyrics></song>
