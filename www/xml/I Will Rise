  <lyrics>[V1]
.G#m                             E
 There's a peace I've come to know
.B                                F#
 Though my heart and flesh may fail
.G#m                         E
 There's an anchor for my soul
.B                    F#
 I can say "It is well"||

.B                F#
 Jesus has overcome
.G#m                        E
 And the grave is overwhelmed
.B                F#
 The victory is won
.G#m                     E
 He is risen from the dead

[C]
.B                                   F#
 And I will rise when He calls my name
.G#m                        E
 No more sorrow, no more pain
.B                          F#
 I will rise on eagles' wings
.G#m                          E
 Before my God fall on my knees ||
.B      E  B         F#
 And rise, I will rise

[V2]
.G#m                             E
 There's a day that's drawing near
.B                                F#
 When this darkness breaks to light
.G#m                     E
 And the shadows disappear
---
.B                           F#
 And my faith shall be my eyes ||
.B                F#
 Jesus has overcome
.G#m                        E
 And the grave is overwhelmed
.B                F#
 The victory is won
.G#m                     E
 He is risen from the dead

[B1]
.F#               E        B     F#
 And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
.E       B         F#
 "Worthy is the Lamb"
.F#              E       B      F#
 And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
.E       B         F#
 "Worthy is the Lamb"

[B2]
.F#               E        B     F#
 And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
.E       B         F#
 "Worthy is the Lamb"
.F#              E       B      F#
 And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
.E       B         F#
 "Worthy is the Lamb"
.E       B         F#
 "Worthy is the Lamb"
. B F# G#m E

[C2]
.B                                   F#
 And I will rise when He calls my name
.G#m                        E
 No more sorrow, no more pain
.B                          F#
 I will rise on eagles' wings
.G#m                          E
 Before my God fall on my knees ||
.B      E  B/F#      E/G#
 And rise, I will rise
.B         F#
 I will rise</lyrics>
