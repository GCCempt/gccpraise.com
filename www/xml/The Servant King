  <lyrics>[V1]
 From heav’n You came, helpless Babe,
 Entered our world, Your glory veiled; ||
 Not to be served but to serve,
 And give Your life that we might live.
 
[C]
 This is our God, the Servant King,
 He calls us now to follow Him, ||
 To bring our lives as a daily offering
 Of worship to the Servant King.
 
[V2]
 There in the garden of tears,
 My heavy load He chose to bear; ||
 His heart with sorrow was torn,
 ‘Yet not my will but Yours,’ He said.
 
[V3]
 Come see His hands and His feet,
 The scars that speak of sacrifice; ||
 Hands that flung stars into space
 To cruel nails surrendered.
 
[V4]
 So let us learn how to serve,
 And in our lives enthrone Him; ||
 Each other’s needs to prefer,
 For it is Christ we’re serving. </lyrics>
