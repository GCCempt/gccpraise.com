[C]
.          C          G
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
.D/F# Em
 O my soul,||
.C             G    Dsus4 D
 Worship His holy name.||
.          C        Em
 Sing like never before,
.C D  Em
 O my soul. ||
.     C              D       C/G G C/G G
 I'll worship Your holy name.
 
 
[V1]
.    C         G           D       Em
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
.C            G            D     Em
 It's time to sing Your song again.||
.C            G              D           Em
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
.C2         G                Dsus4 D  G   Gsus4 G
 Let me be singing when the even- ing comes.
 
[V2]
.       C       G                D        Em
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
.      C       G               D         Em
 Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.||
.    C        G                D       Em
 For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
.C2           G              Dsus4 D  G    Gsus4 G
 Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
---
[V3]
.    C       G           D            Em
 And on that day when my strength is failing,
.    C         G            D         Em
 The end draws near, and my time has come ||
.C        G                   D        Em
 Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
.C2           G                 Dsus D  G           Gsus G
 Ten thousand years and then for-ev-er more! Forevermore
 
[E]
.     C              D    Em
 I'll worship Your holy name.
.             C           D    G
 Lord, I'll worship Your holy name.</lyrics>
