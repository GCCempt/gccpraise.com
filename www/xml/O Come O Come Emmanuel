  <lyrics>[V1]
.  Em      Bm     Am Bm/D Em
 O come, O come, Emmanuel
. D/F# G             Am Bm Em
 And ransom captive Israel ||
.     Am               Em    D
 That mourns in lonely exile here
.G D/F# G          Am Bm/D    G
 Until  the Son of God     appear
 
[C1]
.   D     Em  Bm    Am B7/D# Em
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
. D/F# G       C   G/B Am Bm Em
 Shall come to thee O Israel
 
[V2]
 O come O come thou Lord of might
 Who to thy tribes on Sinai's height ||
 In ancient times didst give the law
 In cloud and majesty and awe
 
[V3]
 O come Thou Rod of Jesse,free
 Thine own from Satan's tyranny ||
 From depths of hell Thy people save
 And give them victry o'er the grave
 
[V4]
 O come, thou Day-spring from on high,
 and cheer us by thy drawing nigh; ||
 disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
 and death's dark shadows put to flight.
 
[V5]
 O come thou Key of David come
 And open wide our heavenly home ||
 Make safe the way that leads on high
 And close the path to misery
 
[V6]
.  Em             Am D      Em
 O come, Desire of nations, bind
.    G              Am       Em
 All people in one heart and mind ||
.    Am               G        D
 Bid envy strife and quarrels cease
.     Em                 Am D      G
 Fill all the world with heaven's peace
 
[V7]
 O come thou Wisdom from on high
 And order all things far and nigh ||
 To us the path of knowledge show
 And cause us in her ways to go
 
[V8]
 O come thou Root of Jesse's tree
 An ensign of Thy people be  ||
 Before Thee rulers silent fall
 All peoples on Thy mercy call
 
[V9]
.  Em                    Am D     Em
 O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
.     G               Am     Em
 Our spirits by Thine advent here ||
.     Am              G        D
 And drive away the shades of night
.     Em                   Am D      G
 And pierce the clouds and bring us light
