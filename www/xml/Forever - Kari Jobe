;Piano Intro
.G D Am C

[V1]
.G                        D
 The moon and stars they wept
.                    Em
 The morning sun was dead
.                    C
 The Savior of the world was fallen||
.G                 D
 His body on the cross
.                        Em
 His blood poured out for us
.                      C
 The weight of every curse upon Him

[I]
.G D Am C

[V2]
.G                    D
 One final breath He gave
.                 Em
 As heaven looked away
.                    C
 The Son of God was laid in darkness||
.G                 D
 A battle in the grave
.                      Em
 The war on death was waged
.                     C
 The power of hell forever broken

[P]
.G                     D
 The ground began to shake
---
.                     Em
 The stone was rolled away
.                        C
 His perfect love could not be overcome||
.G                         D
 Now death where is your sting?
.                Em
 Our resurrected King
.                    C
 Has rendered you defeated

[C]
.           G           D
 Forever He is glorified
.  Em           C
 Forever He is lifted high
.   G           D
 Forever He is risen
.       Em            C
 He is alive, He is alive

;Chorus instrumental before bridge

[B]
.G             D
 We sing hallelujah
.             Em
 We sing hallelujah
.              C
 We sing hallelujah
.                  G
 The Lamb has overcome

[B2]
.G             D
 We sing hallelujah
.             Am
 We sing hallelujah
.              C
 We sing hallelujah
.                C  
 The Lamb has overcome</lyrics>
