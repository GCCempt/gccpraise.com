  <title>My Worth Is Not In What I Own</title>
  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C  F

[V1]
.   C               G      C
 My worth is not in what I own
.    C                  F        C
 Not in the strength of flesh and bone
.    C              G     G#   Am
 But in the costly wounds of love
.F        C
 At the cross

[V2]
.   C               G       C
 My worth is not in skill or name
.    C              F       C
 In win or lose, in pride or shame
.    C               G      G#     Am
 But in the blood of Christ that flowed
.F        C 
 At the cross

[C]
.F             G   Am
 I rejoice in my Redeemer
.         F
 Greatest Treasure,
.           C     G
 Wellspring of my soul||
. F                G     Am
 I will trust in Him, no other.
.            C    F       G    C
 My soul is satisfied in Him alone.

[V3]
.   C               G        C
 As summer flowers we fade and die
.      C              F    C
 Fame, youth and beauty hurry by
.     C             G   G#   Am
 But life eternal calls to us
.F       C     
 At the cross

[V4]
.   C               F          C
 I will not boast in wealth or might
.    C               F       C
 Or human wisdom's fleeting light
.    C              G   G#    Am
 But I will boast in knowing Christ
. F      C    
 At the cross

[V5]
.    C              F          C
 Two wonders here that I confess
.    C              F        C
 My worth and my unworthiness
.    C             G    G#   Am
 My value fixed - my ransom paid
. F     C    
 At the cross  </lyrics>
