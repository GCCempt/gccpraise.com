  <lyrics>[V1]
 Christians, awake, salute the happy morn
 Whereon the Saviour of the world was born||
 Rise to adore the mystery of love
 Which hosts of angels chanted from above ||
 With them the joyful tidings first begun
 Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son.
 
[V2]
 Then to the watchful shepherds it was told
 Who heard the angelic herald's voice: "Behold,||
 I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth
 To you and all the nations on the earth: ||
 This day hath God fulfilled His promised word;
 This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord."
 
[V3]
 He spake, and straightaway the celestial choir
 In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire||
 The praises of redeeming love they sang
 And heaven's whole orb with alleluias rang ||
 God's highest glory was their anthem still
 Peace on the earth and unto men good will.
 
[V4]
 To Bethl'hem straight the happy shepherds ran
 To see the wonder God had wrought for man||
 And found, with Joseph and the blessed maid
 Her Son, the Saviour, in a manger laid ||
 Amazed, the wondrous story they proclaim
 The earliest heralds of the Saviour's name.
 
[V5]
 Let us, like these good shepherds, them employ
 Our grateful voices to proclaim the joy||
 Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss
 From His poor manger to His bitter cross ||
 Treading His steps, assisted by His grace
 Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.
 
[V6]
 Then may we hope, th' angelic thrones among
 To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song||
 He that was born upon this joyful day
 Around us all His glory shall display ||
 Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
 eternal praise to heav'n's almighty King.</lyrics></song>
