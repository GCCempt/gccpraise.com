  <lyrics>[V1]
.Abm 		E
 I wanna see the broken hearts
.B		F#
 finding hope in God above
.Abm		E	B   F#
 I wanna know I’m doing all I can
 ||
.Abm		E
 So with this life, with all I am
.B		F#
 No matter what the cost may be
.Abm		E		B   F#
 I pray to see your love become our cause
 
[C]
.Abm	E
 I won’t stop believing
.B	F#
 You alone are, You alone are God
.Abm	E		E
 In You there's freedom
 ||
 
.B			F#
 Your love brings me to my knees again
.	Abm                         E
 We're gonna bring an anthem of love
.	B	      F#
 We're gonna live for you now
 ||
.B				F#
 May your love become my every thought
.		Abm	      E
 I wanna know the sound of your heart

 I wanna live for you now
 
[V2]
.Abm 		E
 This perfect love, I can't explain
.B		F#
 This way of life that has no end
.Abm		E	B   F#
 Your mercy satisfies, it's all I need
 ||
.Abm		E
 My purpose found in You alone
.B		F#
 to love the lost and bring them home
.Abm		E		B   F#
 We were made to glorify our king
 
[B]
.         E		       B
 Singing You, you bring me life
.	      E
 You bring me hope
.	F#
 You're all I need</lyrics></song>
