  <lyrics>[V1]
 What time I am afraid
 I put my trust in Thee;
 In God I rest, and praise
 His Word, so rich and free.
 ||
 In God I put my trust,
 I neither doubt nor fear,
 For man can never harm
 With God my Helper near.
 
[V2]
 In God, the Lord, I rest,
 His Word of grace I praise,
 His promise stands secure,
 Nor fear nor foe dismays.
 ||
 Upon me are Thy vows,
 O God, in Whom I live;
 The sacrifice of praise
 To Thee I now will give.
 
[V3]
 For Thou hast saved from death,
 From falling kept me free,
 That in the light of life
 My walk may be with Thee.
 ||
 In God I put my trust
 I neither doubt nor fear,
 for man can never harm
 with God my helper near!</lyrics></song>
