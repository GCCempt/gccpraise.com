.D
 As we come into Your house
.       Bm
 And we gather in Your name
.        G
 It’s a privilege to be here
.                         A
 We’re so very glad we came
.        D
 We can sense Your holy presence
.        Bm
 And the warmth of Your embrace
.      G
 As we lift our hearts to worship
.                             A
 We’ll bring the sacrifice of praise
 
[C]
.D
 We bring the sacrifice of praise
.         G                  D
 Into the house of the Lord  
.D
 We bring the sacrifice of praise
.         G                  D
 Into the house of the Lord  
 
.       G           D
 And we offer up to You
.        Em             D
 The sacrifices of thanksgiving
.       G           D
 And we offer up to You
.        Em7         D
 The sacrifices of joy

[V2]
.D
 Lord You’ve taught us in Your Word
.         Bm
 To give thanks in everything
.        G
 You’ll provide a place of refuge
.                            A
 Beneath the shadow of Your wings
.        D
 So we purpose to obey You
.        Bm
 And to walk in all Your ways
.       G
 Lord in every situation
.                             A
 We’ll bring the sacrifice of praise
 
[E]
.       G           D
 And we offer up to You
.        Em             D
 The sacrifices of thanksgiving
.       G           D
 And we offer up to You
.        Em7         D
