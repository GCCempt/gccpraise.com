[V1] 
.A D F#m E
 You are worthy, Lord so holy - Artist of the sky.
 “Strength and power, Yours forever,” 
 one day all will cry.
 You’re our Savior, our great Creator. Majesty on high.
 Abba Father, to You we surrender, lifting up our eyes.

[C] 
.A E F#m D

 We’re asking You to move
 Shake the ground below
 Let Your Spirit flow and turn our desperate hearts to You

 We’re asking You to move                                  
 Reveal to us the Light
 Open up our eyes and turn our desperate hearts to You

[V2] 
.A D F#m E

 You are faithful. You are able to raise the fallen man.
 It is finished was Your sentence - what a perfect plan.
 You're the Author and Perfecter, end what You began.
 In You we live and find our being, and by Your cross we stand.

[B] 
.F#m D A E

 We’re gathered in this place, seeking out Your face -
 Won’t You show?

 Lord, we're covered by Your grace, and we long for Your embrace;
 We are restless, till we rest in You.
