;Version 1
.  D   Bm F#m D G    G/B D   A/C#
 Noel, Noel,  Noel,  Noel
.Bm       G   D       G A  D
 Born is the King of Israel


[V1]
.    D       A       G         D
 The first Noel, the angel did say
.       G            D
 Was to certain poor shepherds
.   G           A   D
 In fields as they lay ||
.   D            A
 In fields where they
.    G             D
 Lay keeping their sheep
.     G             D/Bm
 On a cold winter's night
.     G        A D
 That was so deep
---

[V2]
.     D      A
 They looked up
.    G     D
 And saw a star
.    G          D
 Shining in the East
.   G    A   D
 Beyond them far ||
.    D      A
 And to the earth
.   G          D
 It gave great light
.   G        D
 And so it continued
.     G       A  D
 Both day and night


[V3]
.     D      A
 And by the light
.    G     D
 of that same star,
.    G          D
 Three wise men came
.   G    A   D
 from country far; ||
.    D      A
 To seek for a king
.   G          D
 was their intent,
.   G        D
 And to follow the star
.     G       A  D
 wherever it went.
---

[V4]
.    D           A        G         D
 This star drew nigh to the northwest
.G          D
 O'er Bethlehem
.G           A D
 it took its rest ||
.   D          A
 And there it did
.   G          D
 both Pause and stay
.       G         D        G      A D
 Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.


[V5]
.     D        A        G         D
 Then entered in those Wise men three
.G         D
 Full reverently
. G            A D
 upon their knee ||
.   D          A
 And offered there
.   G          D
 in His presence
.       G          D        G      A D
 Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.


[V6]
.    D      A        G         D
 Then let us all with one accord
.G          D
 Sing praises to
. G            A D
 our heavenly Lord ||
.   D          A
 That hath made Heaven
.   G          D
 and earth of nought
.       G         D        G       A D
 And with his blood mankind has bought.</lyrics>
