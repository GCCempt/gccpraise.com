  <lyrics>[V1]
.    D                A         G     A            D
 The church’s one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord;
.    D            G         G     D       A
 she is his new creation by water and the Word.||
.     D          A        G      D     Bm             Em
 From heaven he came and sought her to be his holy bride;
.     D       G     D  Bm     Em   G       Em  D    A  D
 with his own blood he bought her, and for her life he died.
 
 
[V2]
.    D                A         G     A            D
 Elect from every nation, yet one o’er all the earth;
.    D            G         G     D       A
 her charter of salvation: one Lord, one faith, one birth.||
.     D          A        G      D     Bm             Em
 One holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food,
.    D      G    D   Bm  Em   G       Em  D    A  D
 and to one hope she presses, with every grace endued.
 
 
[V3]
.    D                A         G     A            D
 Though with a scornful wonder the world see her oppressed,
.    D            G         G     D       A
 by schisms rent asunder, by heresies distressed,||
.     D          A        G      D     Bm             Em
 yet saints their watch are keeping; their cry goes up: “How long?” ||
.    D        G     D  Bm   Em  G       Em  D    A  D
 and soon the night of weeping shall be the morn of song.
 
 
[V4]
.    D                A         G     A            D
 The Church shall never perish, Her dear Lord to defend,
.    D            G         G     D       A
 To guide, sustain, and cherish, Is with her to the end:||
.     D          A        G      D     Bm             Em
 Though there be those who hate her, And false sons in her pale, ||
.     D     G    D Bm   Em  G     Em  D    A   D
 Against or foe or traitor, She ever shall prevail.
 
[V5]
.    D                A         G     A            D
 'Mid toil and tribulation, And tumult of her war,
.    D            G         G     D       A
 She waits the consummation, Of peace for evermore;||
.     D          A        G      D     Bm             Em
 Till with the vision glorious, Her longing eyes are blest,
.     D        G      D  Bm   Em  G        Em  D       A  D
 And the great church victorious, Shall be the church at rest.
 
[V6]
.    D                  A          G        A        D
 Yet she on earth hath union, With God the Three in One,
.    D               G         G               D       A
 And mystic sweet communion,  With those whose rest is won:||
.     D          A        G      D     Bm        Em
 O happy ones and holy! Lord, give us grace that we,
.     D         G    D   Bm Em G       Em  D      A   D
 Like them, the meek and lowly,On high may dwell with thee.
