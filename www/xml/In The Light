  <lyrics>[V1]
.C	 D	      Em		       C	 D	      Em
 I keep trying to find a life on my own apart from You,
.C	    D		   Em		        C		    D		         Em
 I am the king of excuses, I’ve got one for every selfish thing I do.
 
[B]
.	C		    D	  Em		       C	     D	      Em
 What’s going on inside me?  I despise my own behavior.
.		      C		 D   Em		
 This only serves to confirm my suspicions
.		     C		         D	      Em
 That I’m still a man in need of a Savior
 
[C1]
.		    C		 G	     D		         Em
 I wanna be in the light as You are in the light,
.		    C		        G	        D
 I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens.||
.	   C		      G	   D	         Em
 O Lord, be my light and be my salvation,
.		  C		    D		     Em    C		D		Em
 ‘Cause all I want is to be in the light, all I want is to be in the light.
 
[V2]
.      C	     D	         Em		    		      C		 D		Em
 The disease of self runs through my blood, | it’s a cancer that’s fatal to my soul.
.C	   D		         Em		          C			      D	   Em
 Every attempt on my behalf has failed to bring this sickness under control.</lyrics></song>
