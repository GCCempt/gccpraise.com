.D             E
 Wonderful, So Wonderful
.   A/C#
 Is Your Unfailing Love, ||

 Your cross has spoken mercy over me 
.   D                E
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard ||
.   A/C#
 No heart could fully know,
.    D             E             A
 How glorious, how beautiful You are

 Powerful, so Powerful
.   A/C#
 Your glory fills the skies ||
.     D                E          F#m7
  Your mighty works displayed for all to see
.   D                E
 The beauty of  Your majesty ||
.   A/C#
 Awakes my heart to sing;

 How marvelous, How wonderful You are

 Beautiful One my soul must sing

 You've opened my eyes to Your wonders anew

 You captured my heart with this love ||

 'Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as You

 My soul, my soul, must sing
