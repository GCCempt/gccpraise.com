  <lyrics>[V1]
. F/A           F/C     F   
 Once in royal David’s city, 
.  F      F/A    C7    F
 Stood a lowly cattle shed,||
. F/A           F/C       F   
 Where a mother laid her Baby,
. F    F/A    C7     F
 In a manger for His bed: ||
. Bb   F        C7     F 
 Mary was that mother mild,
. Bb     F           C7     F 
 Jesus Christ, her little Child.
 
 
[V2]
 
 He came down to earth from heaven, 
 
 Who is God and Lord of all,||
 
 And His shelter was a stable, 
 
 And His cradle was a stall: ||
 
 With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
 
 Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
 
 
 
[V3]
 
 And our eyes at last shall see Him,
 
 Through His own redeeming love; ||
 
 For that Child so dear and gentle,
 
 Is our Lord in heaven above: ||
 
 And He leads His children on,
 
 To the place where He is gone.
 
 
[V4]
 
 Not in that poor lowly stable,

 With the oxen standing by,

 We shall see him, but in heaven,

 Set at God's right hand on high;

 When like stars his children crowned

 All in white shall wait around.</lyrics>
