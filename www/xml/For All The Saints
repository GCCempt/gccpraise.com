  <lyrics>[V1]
.             C                     F       C
 For all the saints, who from their labours rest,
.            G                F         C
 Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
.            G      Am    G    F
 Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.
.   C            G  C
 Allelujah! Allelu!
 
[V2]
 Thou wast their Rock, their fortress, and their might;
 Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;
 Thou in the darkness drear their one true light.
 Allelujah! Allelu!
 
[V3]
 O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
 Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
 And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold!
 Allelujah! Allelu!
 
[V4]
.             C                     F     C
 The golden evening brightens in the west;
.            G                F         C
 Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;
.            G           Am    G    F
 Sweet is the calm of paradise the blest.
.   C            G  C
 Allelujah! Allelu!
---
[V5]
 But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
 The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
 The King of glory passes on His way.
 Allelujah! Allelu!
 
[V6]
 From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
 Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
 Singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
 Allelujah! Allelujah!</lyrics>
