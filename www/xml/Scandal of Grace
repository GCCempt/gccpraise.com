.C
 Grace, what have you done?
.Am            F         C
 Murdered for me on that cross
.  C
 Accused in absence of wrong
.  Am              F        C
 My sin washed away in Your blood
 
 
[P1]
.    Em           F           C
 Too much to make sense of it all
.  Em              F             C
 I know that Your love breaks my fall
.    G                     Am 
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place
.      F             
 So my soul will live
 
 
[C]
.         C
 Oh to be like You
.                              G
 (To) Give all I have just to know You
.                        F
 Jesus there's no one besides You
.                       C     F  Am  F
 Forever the Hope in my heart

[V2]
.C
 Death, where is your sting?
.     Am           F         C
 Your power is as dead as my sin
.    C
 The Cross has taught me to live
.   Am        F                C
 In mercy, my heart now to sing
 
 
[P2]
.    Em          F                 C
 The day and its trouble shall come
.  Em              F               C
 I know that Your strength is enough
.    G                     Am
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place
.      F
 So my soul will live
 
 
[B]
.F        C
 And it's all because of You, Jesus
.     G
 It's all because of You, Jesus
.     Am 
 It's all because of Your love 
.       F
 And my soul will live
 
[C2] 
.          C
 Oh to be like You
.                              G
 (To) Give all I have just to know You
.                        F
 Jesus there's no one besides You
.                       C    
 Forever the Hope in my heart</lyrics>
