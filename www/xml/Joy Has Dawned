  <title>Joy Has Dawned</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.D       Em     D/F#   G A      Bm       Em7     D/A A
 Joy has dawned upon the world, promised from creation
.D     Em        D/F#     G A    Bm      G   A    D
 God's salvation now unfurled, hope for every nation.||
.D/F#     G  D/F#  Em7   A     Bm      Em7       D/A A
 Not with fanfares from above, not with scenes of glory,
.D     Em     D/F# G  A     Bm7     Em7   A  D  D/F# G A D
 But a humble gift of love, Jesus born of Mary.
 
 
[V2]
.D       Em     D/F#   G A     Bm       Em7     D/A A
 Sounds of wonder fill the sky,  with the songs of angels
.D     Em        D/F#     G A    Bm      G   A    D
 As the mighty Prince of Life, shelters in a stable.||
.D/F#     G  D/F#  Em7   A     Bm      Em7       D/A A
 Hands that set each star in place, shaped the earth in darkness,
.D     Em     D/F# G  A     Bm7     Em7   A  D  D/F# G A D
 Cling now to a mother's breast, vulnerable and helpless.
 
[V3]
.D       Em     D/F#   G A     Bm       Em7     D/A A
 Shepherds bow before the Lamb, gazing at the glory;
.D     Em        D/F#     G A    Bm      G   A    D
 Gifts of men from distant lands, prophesy the stor-y.||
.D/F#     G  D/F#  Em7   A     Bm      Em7       D/A A
 Gold a King is   born today, incense God is with us,
.D     Em     D/F# G  A     Bm7     Em7   A  D  D/F# G A D
 Myrrh His death will make a way,  by His blood He'll win  us.
 
[V4]
.D       Em     D/F#   G A     Bm       Em7     D/A A
 Son of Adam, Son of heaven, given as a ransom;
.D     Em        D/F#     G A    Bm      G   A    D
 Reconciling God and man, Christ, our mighty champion!||
.D/F#     G  D/F#  Em7   A     Bm      Em7       D/A A
 What a Savior! What a Friend! What a glorious mystery!
.D     Em     D/F# G  A     Bm7     Em7   A  D  D/F# G A D
 Once a babe in Bethlehem, now the Lord of history.
 
[E] 
.D/F#     G  D/F#  Em7   A     Bm      Em7       D/A A
 What a Savior! What a Friend! What a glorious mystery!
.D     Em     D/F# G  A     Bm7     Em7   A  D  D/F# G A D
 Once a babe in Bethlehem, now the Lord of history.
