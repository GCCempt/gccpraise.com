[V1]
. G                 C/G        G
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
.     G                 D/G
 That saved a wretch like me ||
.  G        G/B       C       G
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
.   G          D/G    G
 Was blind but now I see
 
[V2]
. G                          C/G       G
 ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
.     G                 D/G
 And grace my fears relieved; ||
.   G         G/B       C       G
 How precious did that grace appear,
.   G          D/G   G
 The hour I first believed!
 
[C]
.    G/B      C                  G/B
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.
.           C/E                 G/D
 My God, My Savior has ransomed me. ||
.    G/B    C               G/B
 And like a flood his mercy reigns.
.           Am7 D7        G
 Un-ending love, amazing grace 
 
---
[V3]
. G                     C/G     G
 The Lord has promised good to me,
.     G                 D/G
 His word my hope secures; ||
.  G        G/B       C       G
 He will my shield and portion be,
.   G        D/G   G
 As long as life endures.
 
[V4]
. G                       C/G        G
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
.     G              D/G
 The sun forbear to shine; ||
.   G          G/B       C       G
 But God, who call’d me here below,
.     G     D     G
 Will be forever mine. ||
.     G      D    G
 Will be forever mine.
 
[T]
.     G     D     G
 You are forever mine.
