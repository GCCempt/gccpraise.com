.G          G/F#                  G/B      Cadd9  
 Seems like all I can see was the struggle
 Haunted by ghosts that lived in my past
 Bound up in shackles of all my failures
 Wondering how long is this gonna last
.         Em                         D                                               
 Then You look at this prisoner and say to me “son
.         G                               Cadd9 (no index)
 stop fighting a fight that’s already been won”
.       G  G/F#            G/B   Cadd9 (no index)
 I am redeemed, You set me free  
.          G
 So I’ll shake off theses heavy chains
.G/F#                      G/B         D         Cadd9 (no index) 
 Wipe away every stain now I’m not who I used to be
 
 I am redeemed
 
 All my life I have been called unworthy
 Named by the voice of my shame and regret
 But when I hear You whisper, “Child lift up your head”
 I remember oh God, You’re not done with me yet 
.         G  G/F#          G/B    Cadd9 (no index)
 I am redeemed, You set me free  
.          G
 So I’ll shake off theses heavy chains
.G/F#                      G/B         D         Cadd9 (no index) 
 Wipe away every stain now I’m not who I used to be---because
 
 
.Em                     B7
 I don’t have to be the old man inside of me
.      G                        Cadd9 (no index)
 Cause his day is long dead and gone------- because
.Em                         B7
 I’ve got a new name, a new life I’m not the same
.      G                       Cadd9 (no index)
 And a hope that will carry me home</lyrics></song>
