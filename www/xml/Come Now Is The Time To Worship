. D     D2                 Dsus  D
 Come, now is the time to worship
. A                        Em7       G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart ||
. D     D2                 Dsus  D
 Come, just as you are to worship
. A                      Em7        G    D
 Come, just as you are before your God, come
 
[C]
. G		          D               D2
 One day every tongue will confess you are God
. G                       D   D2
 One day every knee will bow || 
. G                             Bm7
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those 
.    G                 A2
 Who gladly choose you now
