  <title>Weve A Story To Tell To The Nations</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 We've a story to tell to the nations,
 that shall turn their hearts to the right, ||
 a story of truth and mercy, ||
 a story of peace and light,
 a story of peace and light.
 
[C]
 For the darkness shall turn to dawning,
 and the dawning to noonday bright, ||
 and Christ's great kingdom shall come on earth,
 the kingdom of love and light.
 
[V2]
 We've a song to be sung to the nations,
 that shall lift their hearts to the Lord,||
 a song that shall conquer evil ||
 and shatter the spear and sword,
 and shatter the spear and sword. 
 
[V3]
 We've a message to give to the nations,
 that the Lord who reigneth above ||
 has sent us His Son to save us, ||
 and show us that God is love,
 and show us that God is love. 
 
[V4]
 We've a Savior to show to the nations,
 who the path of sorrow has trod, ||
 that all of the world's great peoples ||
 may come to the truth of God,
 may come to the truth of God.
 
[E]
 and Christ's great kingdom shall come on earth,
 the kingdom of love and light.</lyrics>
