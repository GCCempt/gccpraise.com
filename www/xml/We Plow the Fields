  <title>We Plow the Fields</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 We plough the fields and scatter
 The good seed on the land
 But it is fed and watered
 By Gods almighty hand ||
 He sends the snow in winter
 The warmth to swell the grain
 The breezes and the sunshine
 And soft refreshing rain

[C]
 All good gifts around us
 Are sent from heaven above
 Then thank the Lord O thank the Lord
 For all His love

[V2]
 He only is the Maker
 Of all things near and far
 He paints the wayside flower
 He lights the evening star ||
 The wind and waves obey Him
 By Him the birds are fed
 Much more to us His children
 He gives our daily bread

[V3]
 We thank You then O Father
 For all things bright and good
 The seed time and the harvest
 Our life our health our food ||
 Accept the gifts we offer
 For all Your love imparts
 We come now Lord to give You
 Our humble thankful hearts</lyrics>
