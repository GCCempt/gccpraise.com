  <lyrics>[V1]
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost but now I'm found
 Was blind but now I see so clearly
 
[C]
 Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me
 Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away
 
[V2]
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
 And grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed
 
[V3]
 When we've been there ten thousand years
 Bright shining as the sun
 We've no less days to sing Your praise
 Than when we first begun</lyrics></song>
