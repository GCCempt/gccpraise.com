  <lyrics>;Do not use this song for Sunday worship.  The theology of "Second Chance" might be suspect. We get more than a second chance.  Maybe it should be second chances.
 
[V1] 
.G
 You called my name, reached out Your hand
.C                               Am7
 Restored my life, and I was redeemed
.                          D
 The moment You entered my life
 
[V2]
.G
 Amazing grace, Christ gave that day
.    C                                  Am7
 My life was changed when from my shoulders
.                      D
 Fell the weight of my sin
 
[C]
.                            G
 So it’s with everything I am
.                       D
 I reach out for Your hand
.                Em7 
 The hope for change 
.                          C
 The second chance I’ve gained ||
.                    G  
 On You I throw my life 
.                        D
 Casting all my fears aside
.                              Em7
 How could greater love than this
.                 C
 Ever possibly exist
--- 
[V3]
. G
 Consume my thoughts 
.               C
 As I rest in You
.                          Am7
 I’m now in love with a Saviour
.    Am7                      C
 Bearing the marks of His love
 
[B]
.          G
 So I’ll wait upon You now
.          D
 With my hands released to You
.           Em7
 Where a little faith’s enough
.           C
 To see mountains lift and move ||
.           G
 And I’ll wait upon You now
.      D
 Dedicated to Your will
.          Em7
 To this love that will remain
.     C
 A love that never fails</lyrics></song>
