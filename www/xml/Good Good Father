  <lyrics>[V1]
.F            Fsus     F
 I've heard a thousand stories
.             Fsus         F
 Of what they think You're like||
.                   Fsus   F
 But I've heard the tender whisper
.               Fsus    F
 Of love in the dead of night and You ||
.Bb2      F/A
 Tell me that You're pleased and that
.Gm7        C
 I'm never alone
 
[C]
.                    Bb2
 You're a good, good Father,
.                  F/A
 It's who You are, it's who You are, ||
.Gm7          C
 It's who You are||
.                 Bb2
 And I'm loved by You ||

 It's who I am, it's who I am

 It's who I am
 
[V2]

 Oh and I've seen many searching for
. F       Fsus
 Answers far and wide,||
.       F         Fsus
 but I know we're all
.                F          Fsus
 Searching for answers only You provide because ||

 You know just what we need before 
.Gm7      C
 We say a word
 
[B]
 
. C               Bb2                    Dm7
 Because You are perfect In all of Your ways

 You are perfect in all of Your ways||

 You are perfect in all of Your ways
.   C
 To us
 
[V3]

 Oh this Love so undeniable
.         Fsus    F
 I, I can hardly speak||

 Peace so unexplainable

 Call me, deeper still as You

 Call me deeper still into love

 You are perfect in all of Your ways

 You are perfect in all of Your ways
