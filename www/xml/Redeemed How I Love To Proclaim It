  <title>Redeemed How I Love To Proclaim It</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
 Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
 His child and forever I am.

[C]
 Redeemed, redeemed,
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
 Redeemed through his infinite mercy,
 His child, and forever, I am.

[V2]
 Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,
 No language my rapture can tell;
 I know that the light of His presence
 With me doth continually dwell. 

[V3]
 I think of my blessed Redeemer,
 I think of him all the day long;
 I sing, for I cannot be silent;
 His love is the theme of my song.</lyrics>
