[V1]
.G
 Standing on the promises of Christ my King
.C                            C/G  G
 Through eternal ages let His praises ring ||
.G
 Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
. G               C    D7     G
 Standing on the promises of God
 
[V2]
. G 
 Standing on the promises that cannot fail
. C                                    C/G  G
 When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail ||
. G
 By the living Word of God I shall prevail
. G               C    D7     G
 Standing on the promises of God
 
[V3]
. G
 Standing on the promises I now can see
. C                                C/G   G
 Perfect present cleansing in the blood for me ||
. G
 Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free
. G               C    D7     G
 Standing on the promises of God
 
[V4]
. G
 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord
. C                          C/G    G
 Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord ||
. G
 Overcoming daily with the Spirit's Sword
. G               C    D7     G
 Standing on the promises of God
 
[V5]
. G
 Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
. C                             C/G  G
 List'ning every moment to the Spirit's call; ||
. G
 Resting in my Savior as my All-in-All,
. G               C    D7     G
 Standing on the promises of God.
 
[C]
. G         C   Em
 Standing, standing,
. D                           G      C/G  G
 Standing on the promises of God my Saviour; ||
.          C
 Standing, standing
.    G/D              Dsus  D     G
 I'm standing on the promises of God.
