  <lyrics>[V1]
 While shepherds watched their flocks by night, 
 All seated on the ground
 The angel of the Lord came down, 
 And glory shone around
 
[V2]
 "Fear not!" said he; for mighty dread 
 Had seized their troubled minds
 "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
 To you and all mankind
 
[V3]
 To you in David's town this day
 Is born of David's line
 The Savior, who is Christ the Lord
 And this shall be the sign:
 
[V4]
 The heavenly babe you there shall find 
 to human view displayed
 All meanly wrapped in swathing bands
 And in a manger laid"
 
[V5]
 Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
 appeared a shining throng
 of angels praising God, who thus
 addressed their joyful song:
 
[V6]
 "All glory be to God on high
 And to the earth be peace
 Good will henceforth, from heav'n to men
 Begin and never cease!" </lyrics></song>
