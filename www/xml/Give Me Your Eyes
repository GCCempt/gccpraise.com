  <lyrics>[V1]
.Ebm
 Looked down from a broken sky
.B
 Traced out by the city lights
.F#
 My world from a mile high
.C#/F#
 Best seat in the house tonight||
.Ebm
 Touched down on the cold black tile
.B
 Hold on for the sudden stop
.F#
 Breathe in the familiar shock
.C#/F#          
 Of confusion and chaos
.Ebm               B
 Are those people going somewhere?
.G#m         
 Why have I never cared?
 
[C]
.Ebm
 Give me your eyes for just one second
.             B
 Give me your eyes so I can see
.          F#
 Everything that I keep missing
.             C#/F#
 Give me your love for humanity ||
.             Ebm
 Give me your arms for the broken hearted
.                  B
 The ones that are far beyond my reach
.             F#
 Give me your heart for the ones forgotten
.               C#/F#
 Give me your eyes so I can see 
 
[V2]
.Ebm
 Step out on a busy street
.B
 See a girl and our eyes meet
.F#
 Does her best to smile at me
.C#/F#
 To hide whats underneath ||
.Ebm
 Theres a man just to her right
.B
 Black suit and a bright red tie
.F#
 Too ashamed to tell his wife
.C#/F#          
 He's out of work; He's buying time
.Ebm               B
 Are those people going somewhere?
.G#m         
 Why have I never cared?
 
[B]
 
 I’ve been there a million times 
 A couple of million eyes
 Just move and pass me by
 I swear I never thought that I was wrong||
 Well I want a second glance
 Just give me a second chance
 To see the way you’ve seen the people all along
