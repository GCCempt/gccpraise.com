  <title>Sinking Deep</title>
  <lyrics>;Capo 2
[V1]
.G
 Standing here in Your presence
.G
 In a grace so relentless
.C             D
 I am won by perfect love
.G
 Wrapped within arms of heaven
.G
 In a peace that last forever
.C                 D
 Sinking deep in mercy’s sea

[C]

.     Am    Em     G              D                    
 I'm wide awake, drawing close, stirred by grace
.     Am     Em        D
 And all my heart is Yours
.     Am    Em         G                D
 All fear removed, I breathe You in, I lean into
.      C               G
 Your love, oh Your love

[V2]
.G
 When I’m lost You pursue me
.G
 Lift my head to see Your glory
.C                  D
 Lord of all, so beautiful
.G
 Here in You, I find shelter
.G
 Captivated by the splendor
.C                  D
 of Your face, my secret place

[B]
.       G                         Am
 Your love so deep, it's washing over me
.             Em                       C
 Your face is all I seek, You are my everything
.  G                       Am
 Jesus Christ, You are my one desire
.              Em                    C
 Lord hear my only cry, to know You all my life</lyrics>
