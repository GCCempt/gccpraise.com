  <lyrics>[V1]
 Be lifted high, be made more famous through my life
 Let your kingdom come on earth
 I will tell of all you've done, I will tell of all you've don
 
[C]
 I sing hallelujah to you, Father
 I'll worship forever, my Savior
 I give you all glory, Redeemer - I sing hallelujah
 
[V2]
 Be lifted high, I sing of your goodness on my life
 And how your grace has set me free
 All my sins are washed away, all my sings are washed away
 
[B]
 It will be you forever, it will be you forever
 All of the glory and honor, it will be yours forever||
 It will be you forever, it will be you forever
 All of the glory and honor, it will be yours forever</lyrics></song>
