  <lyrics>[V1]
. G        C
 Arise, my soul, arise, 
.      Am              D
 shake off your guilty fears; 
.G               C
 The bleeding sacrifice, 
.      Am          D
 on my behalf appears; 
 || 
.C          G         D/F#   Em
 Before the throne my Surety stands, 
.           D                C
 Before the throne my Surety stands, 
.C          D              G   C  D
 My name is written on His hands.
 
[C]
.G              C              D
 Arise (arise), arise (arise), arise
.C
 Arise, my soul, arise. 
.G              C              D
 Arise (arise), arise (arise), arise 
.C
 Arise, my soul, arise. 
.Am                C     D           G
 Shake off your guilty fears and rise
 
[V2]
. G        C
 He ever lives above, 
.      Am              D
 for me to intercede; 
.G         C
 His all redeeming love, 
.      Am          D
 His precious blood, to plead; ||
---
.C          G         D/F#   Em
 His blood atoned for every race, 
.           D                C
 His blood atoned for every race, 
.C          D              G   C  D
 And sprinkles now the throne of grace.
 
[V3]
. G        C
 Five bleeding wounds He bears;
.      Am              D
 received on Calvary;
.G
 They pour effectual prayers; 
.      Am          D
 they strongly plead for me;
 ||
.C          G         D/F#   Em
 "Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
.           D                C
 "Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
.C          D              G   C  D
 "Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"
 
[V4]
. G        C
 The Father hears Him pray, 
.      Am              D
 His dear anointed One;
.G          C
 He cannot turn away 
.      Am          D
 the presence of His Son; 
 ||
.C          G         D/F#   Em
 The Spirit answers to the blood,
.           D                C
 The Spirit answers to the blood
.C          D              G   C  D
 And tells me I am born of God.
 
[V5]
. G        C
 My God is reconciled;
.      Am              D
 His pardoning voice I hear; 
.G            C
 He owns me for His child;
.      Am          D
 I can no longer fear 
 ||
.C          G         D/F#   Em
 With confidence I now draw nigh, 
.           D                C
 With confidence I now draw nigh, 
.C          D              G   C  D
 And "Father, Abba, Father," cry.
