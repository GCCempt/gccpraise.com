.G D/F# Em C

[V1]
.G           D/F# Em                      C
 Lord I'm tired        so tired from walking
.G    D/F#            Em           C
 And Lord I'm so alone 
.G                   D/F#                 Em
 And Lord the dark is creeping in
 .                    C
 Creeping up to swallow me
.G              D/F# Em                   C
 I think I'll stop          rest here a while

[C]
.G               D/F#             Em                C
 And this is all that I can say right now
.G               D/F#             Em                C
 And this is all that I can give

[V2]
 And didn't You see me cry'n?
 And didn't You hear me call Your name?
 Wasn't it You I gave my heart to?
 I wish You'd remember where you sat it down

[C2]
 And this is all that I can say right now, I know it’s not much
 And this is all that I can give, that’s my everything

[V3]
 I didn't notice You were standing here
 I didn't know that, that was You holding me
 I didn't notice You were cry'n too
 I didn't know that, that was You washing my feet</lyrics>
