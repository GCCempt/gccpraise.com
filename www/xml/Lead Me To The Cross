  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm               A         G
 Savior I come quiet my soul
.      D  A/C#
 remember,
.Bm                     A
 Redemptions hill, where your blood
.G                         D A/C#
 was spilled, for my ransom

[P]
.Em                   A
 Everything I once held dear
.  Bm7       A         G
 I count it all as loss

[C1]
.                G
 Lead me to the cross
.                      D   A
 Where your love poured out
.                    G
 Bring me to my knees
.             D       A
 Lord I lay me down ||
.Bm             G
 Rid me of myself
.           D   A
 I belong to you
.          Em
 Oh lead me
.G              A    Bm
 Lead me to the cross
---
[C2]
.                G
 Lead me to the cross
.                      D   A
 Where your love poured out
.                    G
 Bring me to my knees
.             D       A
 Lord I lay me down ||
.Bm             G
 Rid me of myself
.           D   A
 I belong to you
.          Em
 Oh lead me, 
.   G      A
 lead me


[V2]
.Bm           A
 You were as I
.              Gmaj7
 Tempted and tried
.D   A/C#
 Human
.Bm                   A
 The word became flesh
.                     G
 Bore my sin and death
.                D A/C#
 Now you're risen


[B]
.    D   G    A
 To your heart
 To your heart
 Lead me to Your heart
 Lead me to Your heart</lyrics>
