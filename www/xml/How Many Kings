[V1]
.C                                    Am
 Follow the star to a place unexpected
.Am
 Would you believe after all we’ve projected
.Dm
 A child in a manger||
.C                                  Am
 Lowly and small, the weakest of all
.Am                                           Dm
 Unlikeliest hero, wrapped in his mothers shawl
.Dm
 Just a child
.Dm                         G
 Is this who we’ve waited for?
 
[C]
.C
 How many kings, stepped down from their thrones?
.Am
 How many lords have abandoned their homes?
.Dm                                          G
 How many greats have become the least for me?||
.C
 How many gods have poured out their hearts
.Am
 To romance a world that has torn all apart?
.Dm                                       G
 How many fathers gave up their sons for me?

[V2]
.C                                       Am
 Bringing our gifts for the newborn savior
.Am
 All that we have whether costly or meek
.Dm
 Because we believe||
.C                                                 Am
 Gold for his honor and frankincense for his pleasure
.Am
 And myrrh for the cross he’ll suffer
.Dm                                         G
 Do you believe, is this who we’ve waited for?
.G
 It’s who we’ve waited for
 
[B]
.G                     A# F
 Only one did that for me
 
;Instrumental after bridge (x2)- then back to chorus
. Dm A#
. Am G F E
. Dm G (x5)
 
[E]
. G                     C Am
 Only one did that for me
.Dm
 
.G          C
