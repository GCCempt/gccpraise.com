  <lyrics>; Pastor Wood - DO NOT USE THIS SONG FOR EM WORSHIP - Pastor Wood says "praising my savior all the day long" is not truthful
; Pastor Arthur - My concern is "Perfect submission", 2 times in the beginning of v.2 and 3. Without context and qualification it interprets as "sinless perfection"; it is very, very misleading. 
[V1]
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
 O what a foretaste of glory divine!||
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

[C]
 This is my story, this is my song,
 Praising my Savior, all the day long;||
 This is my story, this is my song,
 Praising my Savior, all the day long.

[V2]
 Perfect submission, perfect delight,
 Visions of rapture now burst on my sight; ||
 Angels descending bring from above
 Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

[V3]
 Perfect submission, all is at rest
 I in my Savior am happy and blest,||
 Watching and waiting, looking above,
 Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</lyrics>
