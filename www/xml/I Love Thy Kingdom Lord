  <lyrics>[V1]	
 I love thy kingdom, Lord, 
 the house of thine abode, 
 the church our blest Redeemer saved 
 with his own precious blood. 
 
[V2]
 I love thy church, O God! 
 Her walls before thee stand 
 dear as the apple of thine eye, 
 and graven on thy hand. 
 
[V3]
 For her my tears shall fall, 
 for her my prayers ascend, 
 to her my cares and toils be giv'n, 
 till toils and cares shall end. 
 
[V4]
 Beyond my highest joy 
 I prize her heavenly ways, 
 her sweet communion, solemn vows, 
 her hymns of love and praise. 
--- 
[V5]
 Jesus, thou Friend divine, 
 our Saviour and our King
 thy hand from ev'ry snare and foe 
 shall great deliv'rance bring. 
 
[V6]
 Sure as thy truth shall last, 
 to Zion shall be giv'n 
 the brightest glories earth can yield, 
 and brighter bliss of heaven.</lyrics></song>
