[V1]
.   E                   B
 To Christ the Lord let every tongue,
.    A               B
 Its noblest tribute bring,
.     E                B
 When He's the subject of the song,
.    A             B
 Who can refuse to sing? ||
.   C#m     B         A     E
 Survey the beauties of His face,
.    C#m    B       A
 And on His glories dwell,
.      A      B      A
 Think of the wonder of His grace,
.    B               E
 And all His triumphs tell.
 
[V2]
.   E                   B
 Majestic sweetness sits enthroned,
.    A               B
 Upon His awful brow,
.     E                B
 His head with radiant glories crowned,
.    A             B
 His lips with grace o'er-flow; ||
.   C#m     B         A     E
 No mortal can with Him compare,
.    C#m    B       A
 Among the sons of men,
.      A      B      A
 And fairer He than all the fair,
.    B               E
 That fills the Heavenly train.

[V3]
.   E                   B
 He saw me plunged in deep distress,
.    A               B
 He fled to my relief,
.     E                B
 For me He bore the shameful cross,
.    A             B
 And carried all my grief; ||
.   C#m     B         A     E
 His hand a thousand blessings pours,
.    C#m    B       A
 Upon my guilty head,
.      A      B      A
 His presence gilds my darkest hours,
.    B               E
 And guards my sleeping bed.
 
[V4]
.   E                   B
 To Him I owe my life and breath,
.    A               B
 And all the joys I have,
.     E                B
 He makes me triumph over death,
.    A             B
 And saves me from the grave; ||
.   C#m     B         A     E
 To Heaven the place of His abode,
.    C#m    B       A
 He brings my weary feet,
.      A      B      A
 Shows me the glories of my God
.    B               E
 And makes my joy complete.
 
[V5]
.   E                   B
 Since from His bounty I receive,
.    A               B
 Such proofs of love divine,
.     E                B
 Had I a thousand hearts to give,
.    A             B
 Lord, they would all be Thine; ||
.   C#m     B         A     E
 A thousand men could not compose
.    C#m    B       A
 A worthy song to bring,
.      A      B      A
 Yet Your love is melody,
.    B               E
 Our hearts can't help but sing!  
 
[E]
.   C#m     B         A     E
 A thousand men could not compose
.    C#m    B       A
 A worthy song to bring,
.      A      B      A
 Yet Your love is melody,
.    B               E
 Our hearts can't help but sing!  </lyrics></song>
