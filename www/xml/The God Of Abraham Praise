  <lyrics>[V1]
 The God of Abraham praise, Who reigns enthroned above;
 Ancient of everlasting days, and God of Love;||
 Jehovah, great I AM! by earth and Heav’n confessed;
 I bow and bless the sacred Name forever blest.
 
[V2]
 The God of Abraham praise, at Whose supreme command
 From earth I rise—and seek the joys at His right hand;||
 I all on earth forsake, its wisdom, fame, and power;
 And Him my only portion make, my shield and tower.
 
[V3]
 He by Himself has sworn; I on His oath depend,
 I shall, on eagle wings upborne, to Heav’n ascend.||
 I shall behold His face, I shall His pow'er adore;
 And sing the wonders, of His grace forevermore.
 
[V4]
 The goodly land I see, with peace and plenty blest;
 A land of sacred liberty, and endless rest.||
 There milk and honey flow, and oil and wine abound,
 And trees of life forever grow, with mercy crowned.
 
[V5]
 There dwells the Lord our King, the Lord our righteousness,
 Triumphant o’er the world and sin, the Prince of peace;||
 On Zion’s sacred height His kingdom still maintains,
 And glorious with His saints in light forever reigns.
 
[V6]
 The whole triumphant host give thanks to God on high;
 “Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,” they ever cry.||
 Hail, Abraham’s God, and mine! (I join the heav’nly lays,)
 All might and majesty are Thine, and endless praise.
