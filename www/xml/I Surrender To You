  <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, You live in me
 You're my best friend
 You're the King of kings
 The beginning and end
 Now that You have my eyes
 I see Your spirit inside of me
 
[C]
 All that I am is for You
 My Savior
 I live by Your word
 And surrender to You
 Here where I stand in this moment Father
 My spirit has been renewed
 I surrender to You
 
[V2]
 You hold the key to my life
 In Your loving hands
 Always by my side
 I offer all that I am
 So glad I realize
 You are the truth and the light
 In my life
 
[V3]
 Everything I need I find in You
 I believe Your promises are true
 I will lift my burdens up to You
 Your loving grace will see me through
