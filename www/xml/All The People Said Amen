  <lyrics>;Intro 
.C G D

[V1]
.C             G    D          Em
 You are not alone, if you are lonely
.C             G    D          Em
 When you feel afraid, you're not the only
.C             G    D          Em
 We are all the same, in need of mercy
.Am         Em7        D
 To be forgiven and be free
.     Am             Em7         D
 It's all you got to lean on but thank God it's all you need

[C]
.G               D          G   
 And all the people said Amen, woah
. C               G       D
 And all the people said Amen
.     C               G              B       Em 
 Give thanks to the Lord for His love never ends
.C                D      C G C G
 And all the people said Amen

[V2]
.C             G    D          Em
 If you're rich or poor, well it don't matter
.C             G    D          Em
 Weak or strong, you know love is what we're after
.C             G    D          Em
 We're all broken, but we're all in this together
.Am         Em7        D    
 God knows we stumble and fall
.     Am             Em7         D
 And He so loved the world, He sent His son to save us all

[B]
 C               G               D               G
 Blessed are the poor in spirit who are torn apart
 C               G               D               G
 Blessed are the persecuted and the pure in heart
 C            G               D                  Em
 Blessed are the people hungry for another start
 Am                               D 
 For this is the kingdom, the kingdom of God</lyrics>
