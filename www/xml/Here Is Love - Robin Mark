[V1]
.C2       G                C2
 Here is love, vast as the ocean
.G                        D
 Loving kindness as the flood
.         G                   C2
 When the prince of life, our ransom
.         G      D/F#     G
 Shed for us his precious blood

[C1]
.                       D/F#
 Who his love will not remember
.        D7                G
 Who can cease to sing his praise?
.       Em7         C
 He can never be forgotten
.           G       D/F#    G
 Throughout heaven's eternal days

;2nd time acapella
[V2]
.C2     G              C2
 On the mount of crucifixion
.          G               D
 Fountains opened deep and wide
.            G                   C2
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy
.         G        D/F#     G
 Flowed a vast and gracious tide

[C2]
.                           D/G
 Grace and love like mighty rivers
.                      G
 Poured incessant from above
.            Em7               C
 And heavens peace and perfect justice
.         G      D/F#     G
 Kissed a guilty world in love</lyrics>
