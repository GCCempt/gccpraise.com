[V1]
.    C       G       F         C
 The first Noel, the angel did say
.       F            C 
 Was to certain poor shepherds
.   F           G   C
 In fields as they lay ||
.   C            G
 In fields where they
.    F             C
 Lay keeping their sheep
.     F             C/Am
 On a cold winter's night
.     F        G C
 That was so deep

[V2]
.     C      G
 They looked up
.    F     C
 And saw a star
.    F          C
 Shining in the East
.   F    G   C
 Beyond them far ||
.    C      G
 And to the earth
.   F          C
 It gave great light
.   F        C
 And so it continued
.     F       G  C       
 Both day and night


[V3]
.     C      G
 And by the light
.    F     C
 of that same star,
.    F          C
 Three wise men came
.   F    G   C
 from country far; ||
.    C      G
 To seek for a king 
.   F          C
 was their intent,
.   F        C
 And to follow the star
.     F       G  C       
 wherever it went.


[V4]
.    C           G        F         C
 This star drew nigh to the northwest
.F          C
 O'er Bethlehem
.F           G C
 it took its rest ||
.   C          G
 And there it did
.   F          C
 both Pause and stay
.       F         C        F      G C
 Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.


[V5]
.     C        G        F         C
 Then entered in those Wise men three
.F         C
 Full reverently
. F            G C
 upon their knee ||
.   C          G
 And offered there
.   F          C
 in His presence
.       F          C        F      G C
 Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.


[V6]
.    C      G        F         C
 Then let us all with one accord
.F          C
 Sing praises to
. F            G C
 our heavenly Lord ||
.   C          G
 That hath made Heaven
.   F          C
 and earth of nought
.       F         C        F       G C
 And with his blood mankind has bought.
