  <lyrics>[V1]
. E                C#m7
 Hungry, I come to You
.          B            A
 For I know You satisfy 
. E              C#m7
 I am empty, but   I know
.      B                 A
 Your love does not run dry.||
.          B       A/C#
 And so I wait for You,
.      B/D#       A
 So I wait for You.
 
 
[C]
.      E               Amaj7
 I'm falling on my knees,
.    E            Amaj7
 Offering all of me.
.      E                Amaj7             E
 Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.
 
[V2]
. E                C#m7
 Broken, I run to You,
.           B             A
 For Your arms are open wide; 
. E              C#m7
 I am weary, but I know
.       B                 A
 Your touch restores my life.||
.          B       A/C#
 And so I wait for You.
.      B/D#        A
 So I wait for You,
