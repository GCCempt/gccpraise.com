  <lyrics>[V1]
.     E                            
 How lovely is Your dwelling place,
. A           B
 oh Lord Almighty ||
. E                                 B
 My soul longs and even faints for You|| 
.     E     
 For here my heart is satisfied,
. A              B
 within Your presence ||
.   E                               B
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings
 
[C1]
.           A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.           B
 Better is one day in Your house||
.           A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.                B
 Than thousands elsewhere
 
[V2]
.      E
 One thing I ask and I would seek,
. A              B
 to see Your beauty ||
.    E                                 B
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells
 
[B]
. C#m7                     B  
 My heart and flesh cry out,
. A                    B
 for You the living God ||
.C#m7                 B      A   B
 Your spirit's water to my soul||
. C#m7                   B
 I've tasted and I've seen,
. A
 come once again to me||
. E/G#
 I will draw near to You
. F#m7                 B
 I will draw near to You
 
[C2]
.           A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.           B
 Better is one day in Your house||
.           A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.                B
 Than thousands elsewhere
.                B
 Than thousands elsewhere

[E]

 Than thousands elsewhere
