  <title>Marvelous Grace of Our Loving Lord</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
 grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,||
 yonder on Calvary's mount out-poured,
 there where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

[V2]
 Sin and despair like the sea waves cold,
 threaten the soul with infinite loss; ||
 grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
 points to the Refuge, the mighty cross.

[V3]
 Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
 what can avail to wash it away? ||
 Look! there is flowing a crimson tide;
 whiter than snow you may be today.

[C]
 Grace, grace, God's grace,
 grace that will pardon and cleanse within; ||
 grace, grace, God's grace,
 grace that is greater than all our sin.
