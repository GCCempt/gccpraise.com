. G

[V1]
.                  G
 There's got to be more, than going back and forth 
.     D
 From doing right to doing wrong 'cause we were taught that's who we are 
.C
 Come on get in line right behind me you along with everybody 
.G
 Thinking there's worth in what you do 
 ||
.G
 Then Like a hero who takes the stage when we're
.D                                        C
 on the edge of our seats saying it's too late 
.                             G
 Well let me introduce you to amazing grace 

[C]
.G
 No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises
.D 
 No matter the scars, still the truth is 
.    C                                      G
 The cross has made, the cross has made you flawless (the cross has made you flawless)
 ||
.G
 No matter the hurt or how deep the wound is 
.D
 No matter the pain, still the truth is 
.    C                                      G
 The cross has made, the cross has made you flawless

[V2]
.                 G
 Could it possibly be, that we simply can't believe 
.          D
 That this unconditional, kind of love would be enough to
.C
 take a filthy wretch like this and wrap him up in righteousness 
.G
 But that's exactly what He did 

[B]
.G       C            C
 Oh yeah oooh-ooo-ooo oooh-ooo-ooo
. G
 Take a breath smile and say 

 Right here right now I'm ok 
.C                     G
 Because the cross was enough 
 ||
.G
 Then Like a hero who takes the stage when we're
.D                                        C
 on the edge of our seats saying it's too late 
.                             G
 Well let me introduce you to grace grace 

 God's grace 

[E]

.G                                              D
 No matter what they say, or what you think you are
.                                         C
 The day you called His name, He made you flawless
.            G
 He made you flawless
 ||
.G
 No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises 
.D
 No matter the scars, still the truth is 
.    C                                      G
 The cross has made, the cross has made you flawless
.G
