  <title>Amazing Love</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.A/D D                  Em          Asus A    Dsus D
 My Lord, what love is this,  that pays     so dear-ly;
.A/D  D             Em   G   A  D
 That I, the guilty one, may go free.

[C]
.  Am7          Am/G    D
 A-mazing love, O what sacrifice,
.    F                    A
 The Son of God giv'n for me.
.   Am7          Am/G   D
 My debt he pays and my death he dies,
.     Am7      D          Am7 G     D   G/D D
 That I  might live, that  I  might live.

[V2]
.A/D D                   Em        Asus A  Dsus D
 And so they watched Him die, despised, rejected;
.A/D  D             Em     G      A   D
 But O, the blood he shed, flowed for me!

[V3]
.A/D D                Em          Asus A      Dsus D
 And now this love of Christ shall flow   like rivers.
.A/D  D               Em    G   A  D
 Come wash your guilt away, live a-gain.

[C2]
.  Am7          Am/G    D
 A-mazing love, O what sacrifice,
.    F                    A 
 The Son of God giv'n for me.
.   Am7          Am/G   D
 My debt he pays and my death he dies,
.     Am7      D          Am7 Am9   D
 That I  might live, that  I  might live.
.   Am7 G     D
 That I  might live.

[E]
.   Am7 G     D
 That I  might live.
