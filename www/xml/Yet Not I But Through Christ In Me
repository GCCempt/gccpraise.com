  <lyrics>[V1]
.              C                   F 
 What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
.             C              Am      G
 There is no more for heaven now to give ||
.          C                        F
 He is my joy my righteousness and freedom
.              C      Gsus      G         Csus  C
 My steadfast love my deep and boundless peace ||

.           F                    C
 To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
. C/E    F       C               Gsus  G
 For my life is wholly bound to his ||
.         C            Dm7        C/E         F
 Oh how strange and divine I can sing all is mine
.        C/G            Gsus  G   C
 Yet not I but through Christ in me


[V2]
.              C                   F 
 The night is dark but I am not forsaken
.             C              Am      G
 For by my side the Saviour he will stay ||
.          C                        F 
 I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
.              C      Gsus      G         Csus  C
 For in my need his power is displayed ||

.           F                    C
 To this I hold my Shepherd will defend me
. C/E    F       C               Gsus  G
 Through the deepest valley he will lead ||
.         C            Dm7        C/E         F
 Oh the night has been won and I shall overcome
.        C/G            Gsus  G   C
 Yet not I but through Christ in me


[V3]
.              C                   F 
 No fate I dread I know I am forgiven
.             C              Am      G
 The future sure the price it has been paid ||
.          C                        F
 For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
.              C      Gsus      G         Csus  C
 And he was raised to overthrow the grave ||

.           F                    C
 To this I hold my sin has been defeated
. C/E    F       C               Gsus  G
 Jesus now and ever is my plea ||
.         C            Dm7        C/E         F
 Oh the chains are released I can sing I am free
.        C/G            Gsus  G   C
 Yet not I but through Christ in me


[V4]
.              C                   F 
 With every breath I long to follow Jesus
.             C              Am      G
 For he has said that he will bring me home ||
.          C                        F
 And day by day I know he will renew me
.              C      Gsus      G         Csus  C
 Until I stand with joy before the throne ||

.           F                    C
 To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
. C/E    F       C               Gsus  G
 All the glory evermore to him ||
.         C            Dm7        C/E         F
 When the race is complete still my lips shall repeat
.        C/G            Gsus  G   C
 Yet not I but through Christ in me


[E]
.         C            Dm7        C/E         F
 When the race is complete still my lips shall repeat
.        C/G            Gsus  G   C
 Yet not I but through Christ in me ||
.        C/G            Gsus  G   C
 Yet not I but through Christ in me
