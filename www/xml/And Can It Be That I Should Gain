  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                Am/C D      G        C D      G     D A      D
 And can it be that I    should gain,|an int'rest in my Savior's blood? ||
.D           G/D     G/B        D         C       G      D        G
 Died He for me, who caused His pain?||For me, who Him to death pursued? ||
.G       G/D       C   A  D   
 Amazing love, how can it be
.     G       C           D       G     
 That thou my Lord should die for me?
 
[C]
. G      D         C      G
 Amazing love, how can it be
.     C       G   Am     C   D   G
 That thou my Lord should die for me?
 
[V2]
.G                  Am/C D   G         C     D  G       D A      D
 'Tis mys-t'ry all! Th'Immortal dies:|who can explore his strange design? ||
.D            G/D     G/B        D      C         G       D           G
 In vain the first-born seraph tries,||to sound the depths of love divine; ||
.G              G/D     C     A   D
 'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore, 
.  G          C         D        G
 let angel minds inquire no more.
 
 
[V3]
.G                  Am/C D   G         C     D  G       D A      D
 He left his Father's throne above,| (so free, so infinite his grace!)v||
.D            G/D     G/B        D      C         G       D           G
 humbled himself (so great his love!),||and bled for all his chosen race.||
.G              G/D     C     A   D
 'Tis mercy all! immense and free,
.  G          C         D        G
 for, O my God, it found out me.
 
 
[V4]
.G                  Am/C D   G         C     D  G       D A      D
 Long my imprisoned spi__rit lay,|Fast bound in sin and nature's night, ||
.D            G/D     G/B        D      C         G       D           G
 Thine eye diffused a quick-'ning ray,||I woke, the dungeon flamed with light; ||
.G              G/D     C     A   D
 My chains fell off, my heart was free,
.  G          C         D        G
 I rose, went forth and followed thee.
 
[V5]
.G               Am/C D G        C    D   G      D    A  D
 No condemnation now  I dread,|Jesus, and all in Him, is mine; ||
.D        G/D     G/B    D        C            G        D      G
 Alive in Him, my living Head||and clothed in righteousness divine, ||
.G        G/D         C  A   D
 Bold I approach th'eternal throne,
.    G         C             D          G
 And claim the crown through Christ, my own.</lyrics>
