  <title>Death Was Arrested</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
. G                     C          G
 Alone in my sorrow and dead in my sin
.Em                        D          G 
 Lost without hope and no place to begin
.     G                      C          G
 Your love made a way to let mercy come in
.     Em                       D       G
 When death was arrested and my life began


[V2]

.G                      C         G
 Ash was redeemed, only beauty remains
.      Em                   D        G 
 (and) My orphan heart was given a name ||
.   G                        C            G
 My mourning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance
.     Em                     D         G
 When death was arrested and my life began


[C1]

.        C        G           Em   D 
 Oh Your grace so free washes over me
.         C                Em               D 
 You have made me new, now life begins with You ||
.          C       G            Em      D 
 It's Your endless love pouring down on us
.         C               Em               D
 You have made us new now life begins with You



[V3]

.  G                           C           G
 Released from my chain, I'm a prisoner no more
.   Em                      D         C 
 My shame was a ransom He faithfully bore ||
.   G                       C            G
 He canceled my debt and He called me His friend
.     Em                      D        G
 When death was arrested and my life began


[C2]

.        C        G           Em   D 
 Oh Your grace so free washes over me
.         C                Em               D 
 You have made me new, now life begins with You ||
.          C       G            Em      D 
 It's Your endless love pouring down on us
.         C               Em               D
 You have made us new now life begins with You

[V4]

.    G                     C          G
 Our Savior displayed on a criminal's cross
.      C                           D         Em 
 (and) Darkness rejoiced as though Heaven had lost ||
.         G                    C          G
 But then Jesus arose with our freedom in hand  
.            Em                     D         G
 That's when death was arrested and my life began


[C3]
.        C        G           Em   D 
 Oh Your grace so free washes over me
.         C                Em               D 
 You have made me new, now life begins with You ||
.          C       G            Em      D 
 It's Your endless love pouring down on us
.         C               Em               D
 You have made us new now life begins with You


[B]
.         G              C          G
 Oh we're free, free, forever we're free
.Em                    D         G
 Come join the song of all the redeemed
.          G              C     G
 Yes we're free, free, forever amen
.     Em                     D         G
 When death was arrested and my life began||

.         G              C          G
 Oh we're free, free, forever we're free
.Em                    D         G
 Come join the song of all the redeemed
.          G              C     G
 Yes we're free, free, forever amen
.     Em                     D         G
 When death was arrested and my life began

.     Em                     D         G
 When death was arrested and my life began

 That's when death was arrested and my life began</lyrics>
