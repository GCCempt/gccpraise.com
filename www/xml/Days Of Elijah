  <lyrics>[V1]
.  G                     C
 These are the days of Elijah,
.    D                      G  C
 Declaring the word of the Lord,
.      G                         C
 And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
. D                      G
 Righteousness being restored. ||
.      Bm                               Em
 And these are the days of great trials,
.    C                        D
 Of famine and darkness and sword,
.       G                        C
 Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,
.    Em7           D         G
 "Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"
 
[C]
.C       G                     C
 Behold he comes, riding on the clouds,
.                 G                  D
 Shining like the sun at the trumpet call. ||
.             G                            C
 So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
.                    G        D      G
 And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.
 
[V2]
.     G                       C
 And these are the days of Ezekiel,
.   D                       G   C
 The dry bones becoming as flesh.
.    G                        C
 And these are the days of Your servant, David,
.   D                       G C
 Rebuilding the temple of praise. ||
.  Bm                          Em
 And these are the days of the harvest,
.   C                            D
 The fields are as white in the world.
.   G                             C
 And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,
.     Em           D         G
 Declaring the word of the Lord!
 
[B]
.G                            C
 There's no God like Jehovah, there's no God like Jehovah,
.G                            D
 There's no God like Jehovah, there's no God like Jehovah.
 (repeat 3x)
 
[C2]
.D       A                     D
 Behold he comes, riding on the clouds,
.                 A                  E
 Shining like the sun at the trumpet call. ||
.             A                            D
 So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
.                    A        E      A
 And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.
