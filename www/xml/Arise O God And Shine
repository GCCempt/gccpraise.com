.          C                  F C
1 Arise, O God, and shine
2 Bring distant nations near
3 Put forth Thy glorious power,
4 To God, the only Wise,
 
.   Am             C          G
1 in all Thy saving might,
2 to sing Thy glorious praise;
3 that Gentiles all may see
4 the one immortal King,
 
.          C                  F C
1 And prosper each design
2 Let every people hear
3 And earth present her store,
4 Let hallelujahs rise,
 
.  Am                 C        G
1 to spread Thy glorious light;
2 and learn Thy holy ways.
3 in converts born to Thee.
4 from every living thing;
 
.  F                     Am         G     F
1 Let healing streams of mercy flow
2 Reign, mighty God, assert Thy cause,
3 God, our own God, His Church will bless,
4 Let all that breathe, on every coast,
 
. F                 Am          G       F
1 that all the earth Thy truth may know.
2 and govern by Thy righteous laws.
3 And fill the world with righteousness.
4 praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</lyrics></song>
