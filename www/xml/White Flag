[V1]
.Eb
 The battle rages on
.Eb
 As storms and tempests roar
.Cm      Ab            Cm  Ab
 We cannot win this fight
.     Cm     Ab    Bb                
 Inside our rebel hearts

 We're laying down our weapons  now
 
 
[C]
.     Cm          Ab 
 We raise our white flag
.Eb    Bb     Cm      Ab   Eb       Bb		 
 We surrender all  to You, all  for  You
.   Cm           Ab          Eb     Bb		     
 We raise our white flag: the war is over

 Love has come, Your love has won

 You took our rightful place
