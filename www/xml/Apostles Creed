  <lyrics> I believe in God the Father Almighty,
 Creator of heaven and earth.||
 I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
 Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
 And born of the virgin Mary.||
 He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
 Was crucified, died, and was buried;
 He descended into hell.||
 The third day he rose again from the dead.
 He ascended into heaven
 And is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,||
 From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.||
 I believe in the Holy Spirit,
 The holy catholic** church,
  
 (**That is, the "Universal" Church of all true believers in all times and places.)||

 The communion of saints,
 The forgiveness of sin,
 The resurrection of the body,
 And the life everlasting. Amen.
