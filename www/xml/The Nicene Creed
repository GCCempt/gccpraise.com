 CONGREGATION:  We believe in one God, the Father almighty, ||

 maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.||

 And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, begotten from the Father before all ages, ||
 God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made; of the same essence as the Father. ||

 Through him all things were made. For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven;  ||

 he became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary, and was made human.  ||

 He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried.  ||

 The third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures.  ||

 He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  ||

 He will come again with glory to judge the living and the dead. His kingdom will never end. ||

 And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life.  ||

 He proceeds from the Father and the Son, and with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified. ||

 He spoke through the prophets.  ||

 We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church. ||

 We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. ||

 We look forward to the resurrection of the dead, and to life in the world to come. Amen.
