  <lyrics>;Intro:
.G EM G
[V1]
.G
 At the cross I find the beauty of the your matchless grace
.Em
 At the cross I see a King who died to take my place 
.Cadd9                                                  G
 Its the moment that you made me clean and pardoned my soul ||
.G
 Amazing grace that I would be alive unto Your throne 
.Em
 Not by my own will but solely by Your will alone
.Cadd9                                       Dsus4
 I'm unworthy of this love you are showing to me
.Cadd9
 I see my desperate need
 
[C]
.    G
 The beauty of the cross is that there's one who has redeemed my soul
.    Em
 The beauty of the cross is that I'm finally free and letting go
.    Cadd9                            Dsus4                         G
 The beauty of the cross is that Your grace has found me just as I am
 
[V2]
.G
 Not by my own words that I may boast or I may come
.Em
 But simply through your Son the sinless and Exalted One ||
.Cadd9                                                  G
 Only through the cross am I made clean to draw near to you
.G
 Saved so that you would receive all glory due Your name ||
.Em
 Everlasting God from age to age you never change
.Cadd9                                     Dsus4
 A true love story remains for all eternity
.Cadd9
 That all the world would see
 
[B]
.     Em
 My sinful soul could only be
.   C
 redeemed by the blood of a sinless King
.        Em
 So you came to the world that You had made
.           C                                     Dsus4
 Conquered sin on the cross and you rose from the grave
