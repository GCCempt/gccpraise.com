[V1]
.       C  
 You are good, You are good
 When there's nothing good in me

 When the darkness closes in

 You have covered all my sin
 
[V2]
 You are peace, You are peace
 When my fear is crippling
 You are true, You are true
 Even in my wandering

 You are joy, You are joy
 You're the reason that I sing
 You are life, You are life,
 In You death has lost it's sting
