  <lyrics>;Note - verse 2 Ebenezer: 1 Samuel 7:12 "Thus far the Lord has helped us"
[V1]
.           G              D                 C        D         G
 Come, Thou Fount of ev-ry blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;||
.           G            D                 C          D      G
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise. ||
.         Em              C               G
 Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above;||
.           G                 D                C      D       G      G
 Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it, Mount of God's unchanging love.

[V2]
.       G             D             C                  G
 Here I raise my Ebenezer, Hither by Thy help I'm come;
.      G                D                C            G
 And I hope, by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home. ||
.      Em                C                   G
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wand'ring from the fold of God;||
.      G              D            C                  G
 He, to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.

[V3]
.      G                 D             C                  G
 O to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be; ||
.        G                D               C                  G
 Let  that grace now, like a fetter, Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee. ||
.         Em              C                 G
 Prone to wander - Lord, I feel it - Prone to leave the God I love;||
.          G                  D                C               G
 Here's my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.

[E2]
.         Em              C                 G
 Prone to wander - Lord, I feel it - Prone to leave the God I love;||
.          G                  D                C               G
 Here's my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.

[E1]
.          G                  D                C               G
 Here's my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.

[E]
.         Em              C                 G
 Prone to wander - Lord, I feel it - Prone to leave the God I love;||
.          G                  D                C               G
 Here's my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.||
.          G                  D                C               G
 Here's my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.

.    D       A       G         D
 The first Noel, the angel did say
.       G            D
 Was to certain poor shepherds
.   G           A   D
 In fields as they lay ||
.   D            A
 In fields where they
.    G             D
 Lay keeping their sheep
.     G             D/Bm
 On a cold winter's night
.     G        A D
 That was so deep

[CX1]
.  D   Bm F#m D G   G/B D A/C#
 Noel, Noel,  Noel, Noel
.Bm       G   D       G A  D
 Born is the King of Israel

[VX2]
.     D      A
 They looked up
.    G     D
 And saw a star
.    G          D
 Shining in the East
.   G    A   D
 Beyond them far ||
.    D      A
 And to the earth
.   G          D
 It gave great light
.   G        D
 And so it continued
.     G       A  D
 Both day and night

[VX6]
.    D      A        G         D
 Then let us all with one accord
.G          D
 Sing praises to
. G            A D
 our heavenly Lord ||
.   D          A
 That hath made Heaven
.   G          D
 and earth of nought
.       G         D        G       A D
 And with his blood mankind has bought.</lyrics>
