  <lyrics>[V1]
.   G               Am   G/B  C
 How deep the father's love for us
.     G              Em   D
 How vast beyond all measure ||
.     G                 Am G/B  C
 That He should give his only son
.     G                 D   G
 to make a wretch His treasure||
.     G                Am G/B    C
 How great the pain of searing loss
.      G               Em   D
 The Father turns His face away ||
.     G                  Am G/B   C
 As wounds which mar the Chosen One
.       G            D  G
 Bring many sons to glory
. G C G C

[V2]
.   G            Am  G/B    C
 Behold the Man upon a cross
.    G            Em  D
 My sin upon His shoulders ||
.  G               Am G/B    C
 Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
.      G              D   G
 Call out among the scoffers||
.    G               Am  G/B    C
 It was my sin that held Him there
.  G            Em    D
 Until it was accomplished ||
.      G                Am   G/B   C
 His dying breath has brought me life
.   G               D   G
 I know that it is finished
. G C G D

[B]
 It is finished, it is finished

 
[V3]
.   A               Bm  A/C# D
 I will not boast in anything
.     A               F#m E  
 No gifts no power no wisdom ||
.    A                Bm     A/C# D
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ
.      A             E   A
 His death and resurrection||
.      A           Bm    A/C# D
 Why should I gain from His reward
.    A            F#m E 
 I cannot give an answer ||
.     A           Bm     A/C# D
 But this I know with all my heart
.      A                  E  A
 His wounds have paid my ransom

[T]
.      A           Bm    A/C# D
 Why should I gain from His reward
.    A            F#m E
 I cannot give an answer ||
.     A           Bm     A/C# D
 But this I know with all my heart
.      A                  E  A
 His wounds have paid my ransom

[E]
.     A           Bm     A/C# D
 Yes this I know with all my heart
.      A                  E  A
 His wounds have paid my ransom
