.D   A7        D   G C#dim D E7  A
 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun 
.D           G  D     Em  D    A
 does its successive journeys run; || 
.D    A       D            G        A
 His kingdom stretch from shore to shore, 
.D/F#   G   C#dim  D   Em  D/A  A7  D
 till moons shall wax and wane no more.
 
[V2]
.D   A7         D  G C#dim D   E7  A
 To Him shall end-less prayer be made, 
.D              G   D    Em   D   A
 and praises throng to crown his head; ||
.D    A          D         G           A
 His name, like sweet per-fume, shall rise 
.D/F#  G C#dim D  Em  D/A  A7  D
 with eve-ry morning sa-cri-fice.
 
[V3]
.D   A7       D   G C#dim D E7  A
 People and realms of eve-ry tongue 
.D              G   D    Em   D   A
 dwell on His love with sweetest song; ||
.D     A      D      G        A
 and infant voices shall proclaim 
.D/F#  G C#dim D  Em  D/A  A7  D
 their early blessings on His name.
 
[V4]
.D      A7    D   G C#dim D  E7  A
 Blessings abound where'er He reigns; 
.D               G    D   Em   D   A
 the pris-'ner leaps to lose his chains; ||
.D     A      D    G     A
 the weary find eternal rest, 
.D/F#  G C#dim D   Em  D/A  A7  D
 and all the sons of want are blest.
 
[V5]
.D    A7   D  G C#dim D   E7   A
 Let every creature rise and bring 
.D        G  D   Em  D   A
 peculiar honors to our King; ||
.D     A      D        G      A
 angels descend with songs again, 
.D/F#  G   C#dim D  Em  D/A  A7  D
 and earth repeat the loud amen!
