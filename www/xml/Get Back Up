  <lyrics>[V1]
 You turned away when I looked you in the eye, 
 And hesitated when I asked if you were alright,  ||
 Seems like you're fighting for you life,
 But why? oh why? ||
 Wide awake in the middle of your nightmare,
 You saw it comin' but it hit you outta nowhere, ||
 And there's always scars
 When you fall that far
 
[C]
 We lose our way,
 We get back up again
 It's never too late to get back up again,||
 One day you will shine again,
 You may be knocked down,
 But not out forever,||
 Lose our way,
 We get back up again,
 So get up, get up,
 You gonna shine again,||
 Never too late to get back up again,
 You may be knocked down,
 But not out forever
 (May be knocked down but not out forever)
 
[V2]
 You're rolled out at the dawning of the day
 Heart racin' as you make you little get away,
 It feels like you've been runnin' all your life 
 But, why? Oh why?||
 So you've pulled away from the love that would've been there,
 You start believin' that your situation's unfair ||
 But there's always scars,
 When you fall that far
 
[C1]
 We lose our way, 
 We get back up again
 Never too late to get back up again, ||
 One day, you gonna shine again,
 You may be knocked down but not out forever,||
 Lose our way, we get back up again,
 So get up, get up
 You gonna shine again ||
 It's never too late, to get back up again
 You may be knocked down, but not out forever,
 May be knocked down, but not out forever!
 
[B]
 This is love callin', love callin', out to the broken,
 This is love callin'. ||
 This is love callin', love callin', out to the broken
 This is love callin'. ||
 This is love callin', love callin', 
 I am so broken 
 This is love callin' love callin ||
 
 Lose our way, (way way way ay ay ay)
 We get back up, (get back up again) ||
 It's never too late (late late late late late late)
 You may be knocked down but not out forever!
 
[C2] 
 Lose our way,
 We get back up again,
 So get up get up
 You gonna shine again ||
 Never too late to get back up again
 You may be knocked down,
 But not out forever
 
[E] 
 This is love callin' love callin'
 Out to the broken,
 This is love callin'.... </lyrics>
