 Christ Jesus cruci-fied
.G            D             G

.                  D       Em     D Em D
 at the cross on which He died||

 And I sink be-neath the waters,
.                    D   Em      D Em
 that Christ was buried in

[C1]
.D     C          G
 I will rise, I will rise,
.    D                  Em
 as Christ was raised to life
.      C          G     D
 Now in Him, now in Him, I live

[V3]
.G           D        G
 I stand a new cre-ation,
.              D        Em        D Em D
 baptized in blood and fire

 No fear of condem-nation,
---
.             D     Em          D  Em  
 by faith I'm justi-fied

[B1]
.         C                             G
 I rise as You are risen, declare Your rule and reign
.         D                            Em
 My life confess Your lordship, and glorify Your name ||
.         C                                G
 Your word it stands eternal, Your kingdom knows no end
.          D                               Em
 Your praise goes on forever, and on and on again

[B2]
.     C                                 G
 No power can stand against You, no curse assault Your throne
.     D                              Em
 No one can steal Your glory, for it is Yours alone||
.     C                           G
 I stand to sing Your praises, I stand to testify
.           D
 For I was dead in my sin

[C2]
.          C            G         
 But now I rise, I will rise,
.   D                    Em
 as Christ was raised to life
.     C          G       D
 Now in Him, now in Him, I live

[C3]
.  G          B7          Em
 O tidings of comfort and joy,
.            D
 Comfort and joy;
.  G          B7          Em
 O tidings of comfort and joy.

[X1]
.    Em 
 God rest ye merry, gentlemen,
.    C           B7
 Let nothing you dismay;
.  Em 
 Remember Christ our Savior 
.    C                 B7
 Was born on Christmas Day ||
.   Am               G
 To save us all from Satan's pow'r
.     Em           D
 When we were gone astray.

[X2]
.     Em 
 From God our heavenly Father
.  C             B7
 A blessed angel came,
.    Em 
 And unto certain shepherds 
.        C              B7
 Brought tidings of the same, ||
.    Am            G
 How that in Bethlehem was born
.     Em           D
 The Son of God by name.


[X3]
.      Em 
 "Fear not, then," said the angel,
.     C           B7
 "Let nothing you afright;
.     Em 
 This day is born a Savior 
.     C           B7
 Of a pure virgin bright,||
.   Am                 G
 To free all those who trust in Him
.     Em                D
 From Satan's power and might."

[X4]
.      Em 
 The shepherds at those tidings, 
.     C           B7
 re-joic-ed much in mind,
.     Em 
 And left their flocks a-feeding,
.     C           B7
 in tempest, storm and wind,||
.   Am                 G
 And went to Bethlehem straightway, 
.     Em                D
 the Son of God to find.
