.    A
 The world is Yours and everything in it
.     F#m7
 It's all at Your command 
.            D              E
 There is no end to Your domain ||
.    A
 The planets shake the galaxies tremble
.     F#m7
 They turn within Your hand 
.             D             E
 There is no end to Your domain 
.              D                E
 No height or depth You don't sustain

 The universe declares how amazing You are  
.     D             E           D                 E
 Over history and eternity You alone are Lord and King
