  <lyrics>[V1]
. A
 I can count a million times
. D
 People asking me how I
.         A					D
 Can praise You with all that I’ve gone through
 || 
.        A
 The question just amazes me
.        D
 Can circumstances possibly
. A			         D
 Change who I forever am in You
 
[V2]
. A
 Maybe since my life was changed
. D
 Long before these rainy days
.       A				   D
 It’s never really ever crossed my mind
 || 
.       A			
 To turn my back on you oh Lord
.       D
 My only shelter from the storms
.          A					D
 But instead I draw closer through these times
--- 
[C]
. Bm        E
 So I pray
.                 D
 Bring me joy, bring me peace
. 	    A
 Bring the chance to be free
. 	   Bm			     E
 Bring me anything that brings You glory
 ||
. 	D   
 And I know There’ll be days 
.                  A
 When this life brings me pain 
.           Bm                                              E
 But if that’s what it takes to praise You
.                            A                D       A       D
 Jesus Bring the Rain
 
[V3]
. A
 I am Yours regardless of
.        D
 The dark clouds that may loom above
. A					D
 Because You are much greater than my pain
 || 
. A
 You who made a way for me
.     D
 By suffering Your destiny
.     A			D
 So tell me what’s a little rain
 
[B]
. A
 Holy, Holy, Holy
. F#m
 Holy, Holy, Holy
. 		  D
 Is the Lord God Almighty
. 		     A          E
 Is the Lord God Almighty</lyrics></song>
