  <title>He Hideth My Soul</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord,

 A wonderful Saviour to me,

 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,

 Where rivers of pleasure I see.


[C]
 
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock

 That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

 He hideth my life in the depths of his love,

 And covers me there with his hand.


[V2]

 A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord,

 He taketh my burden away,

 He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,

 He giveth me strength as my day.


[V3]

 With numberless blessings each moment he crowns,

 And filled with a fullness divine,

 I sing in my rapture, O glory to God

 For such a Redeemer as mine!


[V4]

 When clothed in his brightness, transported I rise

 To meet him in clouds of the sky,

 His perfect salvation, his wonderful love,

 I'll shout with the millions on high.</lyrics>
