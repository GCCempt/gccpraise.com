  <lyrics>[V1]
.C  G/B Am   F    C              F    G C
 All I  once held dear, built my life upon,
.    G/B  Am    F C         Am      G
 All this world reveres and wars to own;
.C     F    G       C   C/E      F   G   Am   C
 All I once thought gain I  have counted loss,
.      G/B Am   F    C      Am       Gsus4
 Spent and worthless now compared to this.

[C]
.G       F6   C     F/G    G    C
 Knowing You, Jesus,    knowing You
.      Am    Em/G    F
 There is no greater thing.
.          C/E             F/A
 You're my all, You're my rest,
.          C/G              F/A
 You're my joy, my righteousness,
.      C/E      F/A  C/G G
 And I love You Lord.

[V2]
.C  G/B Am   F    C              F    G C
 Now my heart's desire is to know You more,
.    G/B  Am    F C         Am      G
 To be found in You and known as Yours,
.C     F    G       C   C/E      F   G   Am C
 To possess by faith what I could not earn
.      G/B  Am   F    C      Am      Gsus4
 All surpassing gift of righteousness
---
[V3]
.C  G/B Am   F    C              F    G C
 Oh to know the power of Your risen life,
.    G/B  Am    F C         Am      G
 And to know You in Your sufferings;
.C     F    G       C   C/E      F   G   Am C
 To become like You in Your death, my Lord,
.      G/B  Am   F    C      Am    Gsus4
 So with You to live and never die.</lyrics>
