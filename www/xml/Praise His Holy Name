  <lyrics>[V1]
 Sing till the power of the Lord come down.
 Shout Hallelujah! Praise His Holy name! (2X)
 
[V2] 
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me;
 I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
 Jesus, Jesus, how I love Thee! Shout Hallelujah!
 Praise his Holy name!
 
[V3] 
 Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free? 
 No, there's a cross for ev'ryone and there's a cross for me.
 Jesus, Jesus, how I love Thee! Shout Hallelujah!
 Praise His Holy Name!
 
[V4] 
 Sing till the power of the Lord come down.
 Shout Hallelujah! Praise His Holy name!
 
[V5] 
 Hallelujah! Praise His Name!  Hallelujah, Lord! Praise His Holy Name! (3X)
 
[V6]      
 Praise His Name, Praise His Holy Name, Prais His Name 
 Oh, Oh, Praise His Holy Name (5X)
 
[E] 
 Praise Him</lyrics></song>
