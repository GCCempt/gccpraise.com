  <lyrics>[V1]
 How gentle God's commands 
 How kind his precepts are!
 Come, cast your burdens on the Lord
 And trust his constant care.
 
[C]
 Come, ye weary and lay down your cares;
 He will give you rest!
 His yoke is easy, His burden is light;
 He will give you rest!
 
[V2]
 While Providence supports
 Let saints securely dwell;
 That hand, which bears all nature up
 shall guide His children well
 
[V3]
 Why should this anxious load 
 Press down your weary mind?
 Haste to your heavenly father's throne,
 and sweet refreshment find
 
[V4] 
 His goodness stands approved,
 Down to the present day; 
 I'll drop my burden at his feet
 And bear a song away</lyrics></song>
