  <lyrics>[V1]
.           C         F    C
 Before the throne of God above
.                            Em
 I have a strong and perfect plea ||
.             F      C     G       Am
 A great high Priest whose name is Love
.         F                G   C
 Who ever lives and pleads for me||
.           F             C
 My name is graven on His hand
.           F              Am
 My name is written on His heart ||
.            F        G         Am
 I know that while in heaven He stands 
.              F             G Am
 No tongue can bid me thence depart ||
.              F             G C
 No tongue can bid me thence depart
 
 
[V2]
.           C         F     C
 When Satan tempts me to despair
.                              Em
 And tells me of the guilt within ||
.         F    C   G       Am
 Upward I look and see Him there
.            F          G  C
 Who made an end to all my sin||
.          F              C
 Because a sinless Savior died
.          F               Am
 My sinful soul is counted free ||
.            F       G    Am
 For God the Just is satisfied
.           F          G   Am
 To look on Him and pardon me ||
.           F          G   C
 To look on Him and pardon me
 
 
[C]
.     G           Em  Am
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
.           F          G      C
 Praise the One, Risen Son of God

.           C          F     C
 Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
.                             Em
 My perfect spotless righteousness ||
.            F   C  G     Am
 The great unchangeable I Am
.            F         G  C
 The King of Glory and of grace||
.          F              C
 One in Himself, I cannot die
.           F                Am
 My soul is purchased by His blood ||
.           F        G         Am
 My life is hid with Christ on high
.               F          G  Am
 With Christ my Savior and my God ||
.               F          G  C
 With Christ my Savior and my God
