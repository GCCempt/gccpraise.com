  <lyrics>[V1]
.C2       G                C2
 Here is love, vast as the ocean
.       G               D
 loving kindness as the flood
.         G                       C2
 When the prince of life, our ransom
.         G      D/F#       G
 shed for us his precious blood ||
.         D/F#
 Who his love will not remember
.        D7                G
 who can cease to sing his praise?
.       Em7          C
 he can never be forgotten
.            G      D/F#    G
 throughout heavens eternal days 
 
[V2]
 In his truth he does direct me
 by his Spirit through his word,
 and his grace my need is meeting
 as I trust in him, my Lord;  ||
 all his fullness he is pouring
 in his love and power in me,
 without measure full and boundless
 as I yield myself to thee.
 
[V3]
 Let us all his love accepting
 love him ever all our days;
 let us seek his kingdom only
 and our lives be to his praise. ||
 He alone shall be our glory,
 nothing in the world we see.
 he has cleansed and sanctified us,
 he himself has set us free.
 
[V4]
 On the Mount of Crucifixion
 fountains opened deep and wide;
 through the floodgates of God's mercy
 flowed a vast and gracious tide. ||
 Grace and love, like mighty rivers
 poured incessant from above,
 and heav’n's peace and perfect justice
 kissed a guilty world in love
 
[V5]
 Bond and pledge of sweet communion,
 all Christ’s benefits divine;
 here, ye saints, is offered freely
 in the bread and in the wine. ||
 Here is love, displayed in splendor, 
 body broken, blood outpoured.
 Signs and seals of mercy offered
 at the Table of the Lord.
 
[E]
.         D/F# 
 Here is love, displayed in splendor, 
.        D7                G
 body broken, blood outpoured.
.       Em7          C
 Signs and seals of mercy offered
.            G      D/F#    G
 at the Table of the Lord.
