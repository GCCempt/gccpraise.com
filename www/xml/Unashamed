  <lyrics>[V1]
.  A2         Bsus4     C#m7
 I have not much to offer you
.       A2          Bsus4  C#m7
 Not near what you deserve
.       A2    Bsus4     C#m7
 But still I come because your cross
.      A2            Bsus4   E
 Has placed in me my worth
 
[V2]
.      A2           Bsus4     C#m7
 Oh Christ my king of sympathy
.           A2            Bsus4   C#m7
 Whose wounds secure our peace
.         A2        Bsus4     C#m7
 Your grace extends to call me friend
.         A2      Bsus4    E
 Your mercy sets me free
--- 
[C]
.          A2             Bsus4
 And I know I’m weak 
.  C#m7
 I know I’m unworthy 
.     A2    Bsus4      C#m7
 To call upon your name ||
 
.      A2              Bsus4
 But because of grace 
.    C#m7
 Because of your mercy 
.   A2          Bsus4 E
 I stand here unashamed 
 
[V3]
.  A2        Bsus4      C#m7
 I can’t explain this kind of love 
.      A2          Bsus4   C#m7
 I’m humbled and amazed
.        A2            Bsus4         C#m7
 That you'd come down from heaven’s heights 
.        A2         Bsus4   C#m7
 And greet me face to face
 
;E - A2 - Bsus4 – A2 (the instrumental between the chorus and the bridge)
 
[B]
.           E
 Here I am
.             A2
 At your feet
.             Bsus4            A2
 In my brokenness complete</lyrics>
