[V1]
.             C
 How could it be
.                        G
 This baby in my arms
.    Em                     Am
 Sleeping now so peacefully
.     F                     G
 The Son of God the angel said
.      C      F G
 How could it be? ||
.  C                          G
 Lord, I know he's not my own
.       Em                    Am
 Not of my flesh, not of my bone
.        F                  G
 Still Father let this baby be
.    C      Esus7 E
 The son of my love
 
[C]
.       Am                                       F
 Father show me where I fit into this plan of yours
.          G                           C    Em
 How can a man be father to the Son of God? ||
.       Am                                      F
 Lord, for all my life I've been a simple carpenter
.        G
 How can I raise a king?
.        F                  G
 How can I raise a king?
 
[V2]
.              C
 He looks so small
.                         G
 His face and hands so fair
.                      Em                              
 And when he cries the sun just seems to
. Am
 disappear ||
.                     F
 But when he laughs
.              G
 It shines again
.    C      Esus7 E
 How could it be?
 
[V3]
.                   C
 How could it be
.                         G
 This baby in my arms
.  Em                     Am
 Sleeping now so peacefully ||
.      F                     G
 The Son of God the angel said
.   C      F   G
 How could it be? 
.   C      F   G   C
 How could it be?</lyrics></song>
