  <lyrics>[V1]
.   E7      A               D
 O Lord my God!  When I in awesome wonder
.          A       E7                   A
 Consider all the works Thy hands have made, ||
.  E7        A                D
 I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
.                 A        E7           A
 Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed.

[C]
.                      D              A
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;
.               E7                    A
 How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!||
.                      D             A
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;
.               Bm         E7         A
 How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!

[V2]
 When through the woods, the forest glades I wander
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, ||
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

[V3]
 And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;  ||
 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
 He bled and died to take away my sin.
---
[V4]
 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
 And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! ||
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration
 And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art!</lyrics>
