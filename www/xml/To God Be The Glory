  <lyrics>[V1]
 To God be the glory, great things he hath done!  
 So loved he the world that he gave us his Son, ||
 who yielded his life an atonement for sin, 
 and opened the lifegate that we may go in.
 
[C]
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 
 let the earth hear his voice!  ||
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 
 let the people rejoice! ||
 O come to the Father thro' Jesus the Son, 
 and give him the glory, great things he hath done!
 
[V2]
 O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood, 
 to every believer the promise of God; ||
 the vilest offender who truly believes, 
 that moment from Jesus forgiveness receives.
 
[V3]
 Great things he hath taught us, great things he hath done, 
 and great our rejoicing thru Jesus the Son; ||
 but purer, and higher, and greater will be 
 our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
