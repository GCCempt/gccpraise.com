 Here we go!
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
[V1]
 I'm casting my cares aside
 I'm leaving my past behind
 I'm setting my heart and mind on You 
 Jesus
 
 ||
 I'm reaching my hand to Yours
 Believing theres so much more 
 Knowing that all You have in store for me is good
 Is good 
 
[C]
 Today is the day You have made
 I will rejoice and be glad in it
 Today is the day You have made
 I will rejoice and be glad in it||
 And I won't worry about tomorrow
 I'm trusting in what You say
 Today is the day
 
[V2]
 I putting my fears aside
 I'm leaving my doubts behind
 I'm giving my hopes and dreams to You
 Jesus
 || 
 I'm reaching my hand to Yours
 Believing there's so much more 
 Knowing that all You have in store for me is good
 Is good 
  
[B]
 I will stand upon Your truth.
 (I will stand upon Your truth)
 And all my days I'll live for You
 (And all my days I'll live for You)</lyrics></song>
