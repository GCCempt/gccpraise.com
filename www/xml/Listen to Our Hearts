  <lyrics>;Intro:
.C G/B  C  D G
 
[V1]
.           C 
 How do you explain,
.           G/B    G
 How do you describe,
.                      C 
 A love that goes from east to west,
. D                       G/B    G
 And runs and deep as it is wide?||
 
.                 C 
 You know all our hopes
.                     G/B  G 
 Lord, you know all our fears
.                   C
 And words cannot express the love we feel
. D                   G
 But we long for You to hear
 
[C]
.                C
 So listen to our hearts
.                 G/B
 Hear our spirits sing
.                      C    D
 A song of praise that flows
.                      G/B    G
 From those You have redeemed ||
.               C
 We will use the words we know
.   D                G       D/F#   Em
 To tell You what an awesome God You are
.                   C
 But words are not enough
.                    D
 To tell You of our love
.                 G/B    G
 So listen to our hearts
 
[V2]
.                        C 
 If words could fall like rain
.                   G/B
 From these lips of mine
.               C
 And if I had a thousand years
. D                        G
 I would still run out of time ||
.                    C
 So if You listen to my heart
.                 G/B
 Every beat would say,
.                   C                       D/F#                     G
 Thank You for the Life, thank You for the Truth, thank You for the Way
 
[E]
.                   C
 But words are not enough
.                   D
 To tell You of our love
.                  G
 So listen to our hearts</lyrics>
