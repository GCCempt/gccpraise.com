. D          
 No mountain 
. A/C#
 No valley
. Bm7         A
 No gain or loss we know

 Could keep us from Your love

[V2]
. D
 No sickness
. A/C#
 No secret
. Bm7         A
 No chain is strong enough
.    Em7                A
 To keep us from Your love
.    Em7                A
 To keep us from Your love

[C]
.    D     A
 How high
.    Bm7   D/F#
 How wide
.          G       D/F#
 No matter where I am
.          F#m         G
 Healing is in Your hands ||
.   D     A
 How deep
.    Bm7    D/F#
 How strong
.            G         D/F#
 Now by Your grace I stand

 Healing is in Your hands

 Our present
. A/C#
 Our future

 Our past is in Your hands
.    Em7                A
 We're covered by Your blood

 We're covered by Your blood

[B]
. D            A/C#
 In all things we know that

 We are more than conquerors

 You keep us by Your love

 In all things we know that

 We are more than conquerors

 You keep us by Your love
 You keep us by Your love
