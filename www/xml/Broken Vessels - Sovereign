.Em  G  Em  G

[V1]
.          Em 
 All these pieces
.           G 
 Broken and scattered
.         Em 
 In mercy gathered
.          G 
 Mended and whole ||
.      Em 
 Empty handed
.           G 
 But not forsaken
.             D 
 I've been set free
.            Em      D 
 I've been set free

[P]
. C 
 Amazing grace
.    D 
 How sweet the sound
.     Em                 C 
 That saved a wretch like me ||
.  C 
 I once was lost
.    D 
 But now I am found
.    Em                C
 Was blind but now I see

[C]
.                 G    D 
 Oh I can see You now
.                 Em             C
 Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
.                G    D 
 Laying Yourself down
.               Em         C
 Raising up the broken to life

[V2]
.            Em 
 You take our failure
.             G 
 You take our weakness
.             Em
 You set Your treasure
.          G 
 In jars of clay ||
.             Em
 So take this heart, Lord
.             G 
 I'll be Your vessel
.            D 
 The world to see
.           Em    D
 Your life in me

[C2]
. G 
 Amazing grace
.    D 
 How sweet the sound
.     Em                 C 
 That saved a wretch like me ||
.  G 
 I once was lost
.    D 
 But now I am found
.    Em                C
 Was blind but now I see


[E1]
.C                       Am
 In your everlasting arms
.                      F
 All the pieces of my life
.                       Am
 From beginning to the end
.        G
 I can trust you||
.C                         Am
 In your never failing love
.                         F
 You work everything for good
.                      Am
 God whatever comes my way
.         G
 I will trust you

[E2]
. F                     Am
 God whatever comes my way
.         G
 I will trust you

[E3]
.C          F            Am
 All my hopes, all I need
. G
 Held in your hands
.C          F        Am
 All my life, all of me
.      G
 Held in your hands
.C          F             Am
 All my fears, all my dreams
.     G
 Held in your hands
