.B E G#m E 


[V1]
.B                         
 Grace, what have You done?
.E                       B    
 Murdered for me on that cross
. B
 Accused in absence of wrong
.   E                       B    
 My sin washed away in Your blood||
.    E                           
 Too much to make sense of it all
.  G#m                           B   
 I know that Your love breaks my fall
.    E                     G#m             
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place
.      E             
 So my soul will live


[C1]
.         B       
 Oh to be like You
.                        E       
 Give all I have just to know You
.                        G#m      
 Jesus, there's no one besides You
.                       E    
 Forever the hope in my heart

.B E G#m E 


[V2]
.B                          
 Death, where is your sting?
.     E                      B  
 Your power is as dead as my sin
.    B                          
 The cross has taught me to live
.    E                      B   
 And mercy, my heart now to sing||
.    E                             
 The day and its trouble shall come
.  G#m                        B     
 I know that Your strength is enough
.    E                     G#m             
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place
.      E             
 So my soul will live


[C2]
.         B       
 Oh to be like You
.                        E       
 Give all I have just to know You
.                        G#m      
 Jesus, there's no one besides You
.                       E    
 Forever the hope in my heart||

.         B       
 Oh to be like You
.                        E       
 Give all I have just to know You
.                        G#m      
 Jesus, there's no one besides You
 Forever the hope
.   E                        
 Forever the hope in my heart

.B                      
 I'd be lost, I'd be lost
.                    F# 
 I'd be lost without you
 Now I'm found singing Your praise

.G#m                    
 I'd be lost, I'd be lost
.                    E  
 I'd be lost without you
