.C G Dm Am F G

[V1]
.    Am                               F
 You thought of us before the world began to breathe
.    G/B                              C     G/B
 You knew our names before we came to be ||
.    Am                          F
 You saw the very day we'd fall away from You
.        G/B                      C           G/B
 And how desperately we need to be redeemed


[P]
.     F          
 Lord Jesus 
.      G
 come lead us
.      Dm                 G
 We're desperate for Your touch


[C]
.C                      G 
 Oh Great and Mighty One, with one desire we come
.Dm      Am           F               G
 That You would reign, that You would reign in us ||
.C                          G 
 We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice
.Dm      Am           F               G
 That You would reign, that You would reign in us


[V2]
.    Am                               F
 Spirit of the Living God fall fresh again
.    G/B                              C     G/B
 Come search our hearts and purify our lives ||
.    Am                          F
 We need Your perfect love, we need Your discipline
.        G/B                      C           G/B
 We're lost unless You guide us with Your light

[B]
.   G                F         C                G
 We cry out for Your life to revive us, cry out
.         F         C              G
 For Your love to defy us, cry out
.         F        C       Am                        G
 For Your mercy to keep us blameless until You return

[I]
.F C G

[E]
.  F              C        G
 So, reign please reign in us
.     Am         F          C         G
 Come purify our hearts, we need Your touch ||
.     Am                F         C       G
 Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out
.       Am                 F         C        G
 So the world may know You reign You reign in us</lyrics>
