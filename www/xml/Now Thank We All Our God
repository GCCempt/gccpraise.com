. F           Bb      F
 Now thank we all our God, 
.F    Gm     F   C    F/C  C7  F
 with heart and hands and voices, ||
. F            Bb          F
 who wondrous things has done, 
.F   Gm    F    C    F/C C7  F
 in whom this world re-joi-ces; 
 
 ||
.C   G/B   C   F  F/A   C
 who from our mothers' arms 
.C/E   F     C/E Dm  E  Am 
 hath blessed us on our way ||
.Am/G   D   D7   Gm   D   Gm 
 with countless gifts of love, 
.F/A Gm/Bb   F/C  C7  F
 and still is ours today.
 
[V2]
.    F        Bb       F
 O may this bounteous God 
.  F     Gm   F   C  F/C  C7   F
 through all our life be near us, ||
. F         Bb      F
 with ever joyful hearts 
.F    Gm  F    C  F/C  C7    F
 and blessed peace to cheer us; 
 
 ||
.C    G/B  C  F  F/A   C
 and keep us in His grace, 
.C/E   F   C/E Dm    E   Am 
 and guide us when perplexed; ||
.Am/G  D   D7  Gm  D   Gm 
 and free us from all ills, 
.F/A Gm/Bb F/C C7      F
 in this world and the next.
 
[V3]
. F               Bb       F
 All praise and thanks to God 
. F   Gm  F  C F/C  C7  F
 the Father now be gi-ven; ||
. F           Bb        F
 the Son, and him who reigns 
.F    Gm    F  C  F/C  C7  F
 with them in highest heaven; 
 
 ||
.C   G/B  C  F F/A   C
 the one e-ter-nal God, 
.C/E    F   C/E  Dm     E  Am 
 whom earth and heavâ€™n a-dore; ||
.Am/G  D  D7  Gm   D  Gm 
 for thus it was, is now, 
. F/A Gm/Bb   F/C  C7  F
 and shall be ev-er-more.</lyrics>
