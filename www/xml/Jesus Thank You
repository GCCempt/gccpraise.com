; The chorus depicts God’s “wrath” being satisfied. It is actually God’s justice being satisfied according to the Bible.
; While God’s wrath is a result of our sins, it is more accurate to describe as God’s justice being satisfied.  
; Changed lyrics in chorus from “the Father’s wrath completely satisfied” to “the Father’s justice fully satisfied”
; This change is in line with the Bible; it is also the language used in the Westminster Confession of Faith Section 8.5.   </lyrics>
