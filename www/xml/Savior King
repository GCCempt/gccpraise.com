  <lyrics>[V1]
.            C#m      B      E
 And now the weak say I have strength
.  F#m         C#m            C#m     B       E
 By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead
.            C#m        B      E            F#m        C#m
 And now the poor stand and confess that my portion is Him
.        E    B    E
 And Iâ€™m more than blessed
 
[P]
.C#m                   A
 Let now our hearts burn with a flame
.                     E              B
 A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
.C#m          A
 And with the heavens we declare
.     F#m   B
 You are our king.
 
[C]
.       E
 We love You Lord
.    C#m
 We worship You
.     B
 You are our God
.       E
 You alone are good
--- 
[V2]
.      C#m           B      E
 Let now your church shines as the bride
.  F#m         C#m            C#m     B       E
 That You saw in Your heart as You offered up your life
.     C#m     B        E          F#m       C#m
 Let now the lost be welcomed home by the saved and the redeemed
.       E      B       E
 Those adopted as your own
 
 
[C2]
.        E
 You asked your son
.  C#m
 To carry this
.   B
 The heavy cross
.       E
 Our weight on sin
.    E
 I love you lord
.   C#m
 I worship you
.        B
 Hope which was lost
.      E
 Now stands renewed
.          E
 I give my life
.         C#m
 To honor this
.            B
 The love of Christ
.            E
