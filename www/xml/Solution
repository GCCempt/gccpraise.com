  <lyrics>[V1]
. B
 It is not a human right
. B
 To stand afar while broken nations dream
. B
 Open up our eyes, so blind
.B
 That we might find the mercy for the need
 
[V2]
.               B	  
 It is not too far a cry
.     F#             E
 Too much to try to help the least of these
.                    B	         F# 
 Politicians should not decide if we should rise
.    E
 And be your hands and feet
 
[P]
.Abm   E
 Hey now
.           B	              F#
 Fill our hearts with your compassion
.Abm  E
 Hey now
.   	B	      F#
 As we hold to our confession

[V3]
.                  B
 Higher than our circumstance
.       F#	        E
 Your promise and your love for all to see
.                   B 		     F#
 Higher than our protest lines and dollar signs
.       E
 Your love is all we need
 
 
 
[B]
.     Abm                E
 Only you can mend the broken heart
.      B	                F#
 And cause the blind to see
.     Abm		 E
 You erase complete the sinner's past
.     B		      F#
 And set the captives free ||
 
.     Abm	        E
 Only you can take the widow's cry
.      B	                F#
 And cause the heart to see
---
.        Abm		E
 Be the Father to the fatherless

 We will be your light
