[V1]
.F#  G#m  E           F#  G#m       E
     Heaven thundered and the world was born
.F#  G#m  E              F#      G#m           E
     Life begins and ends in the dust You formed
.F#  G#m  E          F#  G#m       E
     Faith commanded and the mountains moved
.F#  G#m  E             F#        G#m           E
     Fear is losing ground to our hope in You

.F#  G#m  E            F#  G#m      E
     Mercy triumphed  when the third day dawned

     Darkness was denied when the storm was gone
