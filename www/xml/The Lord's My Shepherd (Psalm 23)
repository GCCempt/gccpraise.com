  <title>The Lord's My Shepherd (Psalm 23)</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.               F         C        F
 The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want;
.             F      Bb       C
 He makes me lie in pastures green.||
.             Bb      C           F   Dm
 He leads me by the still, still waters,
.      Gm         C         F
 His goodness restores my soul.
 
[C]
.            F        C      F
 And I will trust in You alone,
.            F       Bb      C
 And I will trust in You alone,||
.          Bb      C     F      Dm
 For Your endless mercy follows me,
.       Gm            C       F
 Your goodness will lead me home.
 
[V2]
.              F        C      F
 He guides my ways in righteousness,
.            F      Bb        C
 And He anoints my head with oil,||
.        Bb       C    F        Dm
 And my cup, it overflows with joy,
.   Gm           C       F
 I feast on His pure delights.
 
[V3]
.               F        C      F
 And though I walk the darkest path,
.             F       Bb    C
 I will not fear the evil one,||
.             Bb       C        F       Dm
 For You are with me, and Your rod and staff
.          Gm        C       F
 Are the comfort I need to know.</lyrics>
