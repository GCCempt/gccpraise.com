  <lyrics>[V1]
 Let us with a gladsome mind
 Praise the Lord, for He is kind
 For His mercies shall endure
 Ever faithful, ever sure
 
[V2]
 Let us sound His name abroad
 For of gods He is the God:
 For His mercies shall endure
 Ever faithful, ever sure
 
[V3]
 He, with all-commanding might
 Filled the new-made world with light
 For His mercies shall endure
 Ever faithful, ever sure
 
[V4]
 All things living He does feed;
 His full hand supplies their need:
 For His mercies shall endure
 Ever faithful, ever sure
 
[V5]
 He His chosen race did bless
 In the wasteful wilderness
 For His mercies shall endure
 Ever faithful, ever sure
 
[V6]
 He has with a piteous eye
 Looked upon our misery:
 For His mercies shall endure
 Ever faithful, ever sure
 
[V7]
 Let us with a gladsome mind
 Praise the Lord, for He is kind
 For His mercies shall endure
 Ever faithful, ever sure
