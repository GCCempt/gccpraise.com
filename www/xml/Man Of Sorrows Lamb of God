  <title>Man Of Sorrows Lamb of God</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.G              C       G
 Man of sorrows Lamb of God
.C      G   D
 By His own betrayed ||
.Em                 C        Em
 The sin of man and wrath of God
.    C       D
 Has been on Jesus laid

[V2]
.G            C     G
 Silent as He stood accused
.C      G          D
 Beaten mocked and scorned ||
.Em            C        Em
 Bowing to the Father's will
.   C      D        G
 He took a crown of thorns

[C]
.        Em     C
 Oh that rugged cross
.   G     D
 My salvation ||
.          Em           C       D
 Where Your love poured out over me
.       C         G
 Now my soul cries out ||
.   D    Em
 Hallelujah
.           C      D  G
 Praise and honour unto Thee

[V3]
.G              C       G
 Sent of heaven God's own Son
.C      G   D
 To purchase and redeem ||
.Em            C        Em
 And reconcile the very ones
.   C      D        G
 Who nailed Him to that tree

[B]
.       Em      C
 Now my debt is paid
.      G       D
 It is paid in full ||
.       Em       C
 By the precious blood
.      G        D
 That my Jesus spilled||
.        Em       C
 Now the curse of sin
.       G       D
 Has no hold on me ||
.        Em        C
 Whom the Son sets free
.      G     D
 Oh is free indeed

[V4]
. G                C      G
 See the stone is rolled away
.  C        G      D
 Behold the empty tomb ||
. Em         C      Em
 Hallelujah God be praised
.     C     D        G
 He's risen from the grave

[E]
.           C      D  G
 Praise and honour unto Thee</lyrics>
