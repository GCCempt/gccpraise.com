  <title>His Robes For Mine</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.D   A7        D             A7      D
 His robes for mine: O wonderful exchange!
.        A7    D           G        Em7          A
 Clothed in my sin, Christ suffered ‘neath God’s rage.||
.       D/F#   G         A        A7/G   F#m Bm7
 Draped in His righteousness, I’m justified.
.   F#m/A   G       D/A    A7       D
 In Christ I live, for in my place He died.

[C]
.           Bm        E/G#          A
 I cling to Christ, and marvel at the cost
. D/F#    G      A       A7/G       D/F#
 Jesus forsaken, God estranged from God.
.               Bm     E/G#           A D/F# G
 Bought by such love, my life is not my own.
.   D/F#      G         Em7  A7     D
 My praise-my all-shall be for Christ alone.

[V2]
.D   A7        D             A7      D
 His robes for mine: what cause have I for dread?
.        A7    D           G        Em7          A
 God’s daunting Law Christ mastered in my stead.||
.       D/F#   G         A        A7/G   F#m Bm7
 Faultless I stand with righteous works not mine,
.   F#m/A   G       D/A    A7       D
 Saved by my Lord’s vicarious death and life.

[V3]
.D   A7        D             A7      D
 His robes for mine: God’s justice is appeased.
.        A7    D           G        Em7          A
 Jesus is crushed, and thus the Father’s pleased.||
.       D/F#   G         A        A7/G   F#m Bm7
 Christ drank God’s wrath on sin, then cried “‘Tis done!”
.   F#m/A   G       D/A    A7       D
 Sin’s wage is paid; propitiation won.

[V4]
.D   A7        D             A7      D
 His robes for mine: such anguish none can know.
.        A7    D           G        Em7          A
 Christ, God’s beloved, condemned as though His foe.||
.       D/F#   G         A        A7/G   F#m Bm7
 He, as though I, accursed and left alone;
.   F#m/A   G       D/A    A7       D
 I, as though He, embraced and welcomed home!

[E]
.   D/F#      G         Em7  A7     D
 My praise-my all-shall be for Christ alone.</lyrics>
