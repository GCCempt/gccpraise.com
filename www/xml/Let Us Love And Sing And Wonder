[V1]
.G                       D
 Let us love and sing and wonder
.Em                          C  D
 Let us praise the Savior’s name
.G                               D
 He has hushed the law’s loud thunder
.Em                    C
 He has quenched Mount Sinai’s flame ||
.       Em                 C
 He has washed us with His blood
.       Em                 C
 He has washed us with His blood
.       Em                 C
 He has washed us with His blood
.       D                  G D Em C
 He has brought us nigh to God
 
[V2]
.G                       D
 Let us love the Lord Who bought us
.Em                    C D
 Pitied us when enemies
.G                               D
 Called us by His grace and taught us
.Em                    C
 Gave us ears and gave us eyes ||
.Em                    C
 He has washed us with His blood
.Em                    C
 He has washed us with His blood
.Em                    C
 He has washed us with His blood
.       D                  G D Em C
 He presents our souls to God

[V3]
.G                       D
 Let us sing though fierce temptation
.Em                          C D
 Threaten hard to bear us down
.G                               D
 For the Lord, our strong salvation,
.Em C
 Holds in view the conqu’ror’s crown ||
.Em                    C
 He, Who washed us with His blood,
.Em                    C
 He, Who washed us with His blood,
.Em                    C
 He, Who washed us with His blood,
.       D                  G D Em C
 Soon will bring us home to God
 
[V4]
.G                       D
 Let us wonder grace and justice
.Em                          C  D
 Join and point to mercy’s store
.G                               D
 When through grace in Christ our trust is
.Em                    C
 Justice smiles and asks no more ||
.Em                    C
 He Who washed us with His blood
.Em                    C
 He Who washed us with His blood
.Em                    C
 He Who washed us with His blood
.       D                  G D Em C
 Has secured our way to God
 
[V5]
.G                       D
 Let us praise and join the chorus
.Em                          C  D
 Of the saints enthroned on high
.G                              D
 Here they trusted Him before us
.Em                    C
 Now their praises fill the sky ||
.Em                    C
 Thou hast washed us with Thy blood
.Em                    C
 Thou hast washed us with Thy blood
.Em                    C
 Thou hast washed us with Thy blood
.       D                  G D Em C
 Thou art worthy Lamb of God</lyrics></song>
