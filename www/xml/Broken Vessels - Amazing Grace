  <lyrics>;Intro
.Em  G  Em  G

[V1]
.          Em 
 All these pieces
.           G 
 Broken and scattered
.         Em 
 In mercy gathered
.          G 
 Mended and whole ||
.      Em 
 Empty handed
.           G 
 But not forsaken
.             D 
 I've been set free
.            Em      D 
 I've been set free

[P]
. C 
 Amazing grace
.    D 
 How sweet the sound
.     Em                 C 
 That saved a wretch like me ||
.  C 
 I once was lost
.    D 
 But now I am found
.    Em                C
 Was blind but now I see

[C]
.                 G    D 
 Oh I can see You now
.                 Em             C
 Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
.                G    D 
 Laying Yourself down
.               Em         C
 Raising up the broken to life

[V2]
.            Em 
 You take our failure
.             G 
 You take our weakness
.             Em
 You set Your treasure
.          G 
 In jars of clay ||
.             Em
 So take this heart, Lord
.             G 
 I'll be Your vessel
.            D 
 The world to see
.           Em    D
 Your life in me

[C2]
. G 
 Amazing grace
.    D 
 How sweet the sound
.     Em                 C 
 That saved a wretch like me ||
.  G 
 I once was lost
.    D 
 But now I am found
.    Em                C
 Was blind but now I see
