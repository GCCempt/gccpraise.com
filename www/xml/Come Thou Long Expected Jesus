  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                A      B
 Come, Thou long-expected Jesus,
.E               A       E
 Born to set Thy people free; ||
.E                  A      B      
 From our fears and sins release us;
.E               A       E
 Let us find our rest in Thee.||
.G#m      C#m7         F#m  B
 Israel's strength and consolation,
.E               A          B
 Hope of all the earth Thou art,||
.E    F#m       E     B
 Dear Desire of ev'ry nation,
.E      A     E   B   E
 Joy of ev'ry longing heart.
 
[V2]
.E                A      B
 Joy to those who long to see thee, 
.E               A       E
 Day-spring from on high, appear;||
.E                  A      B      
 come, thou promised Rod of Jesse;
.E               A       E
 of thy birth we long to hear!||
.G#m      C#m7         F#m  B
 O'er the hills the angels singing,
.E               A          B
 News, glad tidings of a birth:||
.E    F#m       E     B
 "Go to him, your praises bringing;
.E      A     E   B   E
 Christ the Lord has come to earth."
 
[V3]
.E                A      B
 Come to earth to taste our sadness,
.E               A       E
 he whose glories knew no end;||
.E                  A      B      
 by his life he brings us gladness;
.E               A       E
 our Redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.||
.G#m      C#m7         F#m  B
 Leaving riches without number,
.E               A          B
 born within a cattle stall;||
.E    F#m       E     B
 this the everlasting wonder,
.E      A     E   B   E
 Christ was born the Lord of all.
 
 
[V4]
.E         	   A     B
 Born Thy people to deliver,
.E		 A     E
 Born a child and yet a King,||
.E                A     B
 Born to reign in us forever,
.E                A       E
 Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.||
.G#m      C#m   F#m   B
 By Thine own eternal Spirit
.E               A        B
 Rule in all our hearts alone;||
.E  F#m	   E      B    
 By Thine all-sufficient merit
.E             A         E        B       E
 Raise us to Thy glorious throne</lyrics>
