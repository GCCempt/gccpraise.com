.G                           Am/F#
 As little children we would dream of
.B         Em       Dm7     G         C
 Christmas morn and all the gifts and toys
.   G/B       Am7
 we knew we'd find,||
.       B        Em           Em/D             Em/C#
 but we never realised a baby born one blessed night
.            Cmaj7         Am7    D7
 gave us the greatest gift of our lives.
 
[C1]
.G                      Am/G
 We were the reason that He gave His life,
.Dsus4       D              G
 we were the reason that He suffered and died,||
.D/F#   Em                           Am7
 to a   world that was lost, He gave all He could give
.  D7                    G
 to show us the reason to live.
 
[V2]
.G              Am/F#
 As the years go by we learned more
.B       Em   Dm7    G     C
 about gifts, giving of ourselves
.    G/B       Am7
 and what that means. ||
.     B               Em           Em/D            Em/C#
 On a dark and cloudy day a man hung crying in the rain
.          Cmaj7   Am7        D7
 because of love,   because of love.
 
[B]
.Eb                              Bb/D
 I've finally found a reason for living,
.        Bbm                     Ab/C
 it's in giving every part of my heart to Him,||
.   Abm/B                Eb/Ab       Cm7
 In all that I do, every word that I say,
.   F                       Ab       E
 I'll be giving my all just for Him, for Him.
 
 
[C2]
.    Amaj7                  Bm7/A
 And we are the reason that He gave His life,
.Bm/Ab      G/C#           F#m7         A
 we are the reason that He suffered and died,
.Dmaj9               A/C#
 to a world that was lost,
.        Bm           Bm7/A
 He gave all He could give,
.   Bm/Ab       G/C#      F#m  Fmaj7
 to show us the reason to live.
.D                  A
 He is my reason to live.</lyrics></song>
