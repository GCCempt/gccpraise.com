  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                 G
 Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
. D      Bm         Em       A
 Just to take him at his word
.D              G
 Just to rest upon his promise
. Em D/F# G         Asus  A    D
 And to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

[C]
. D     D/F#    G       Asus   A
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
. D      Bm          Em        A
 How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
. D     D/F    G
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
. Em D/F# G       Asus   A   D
 O for grace to trust him more!

[V2]
.D                 G
 O how sweet to trust in Jesus
. D      Bm         Em       A
 Just to trust his cleansing blood
.D              G
 Just in simple faith to plunge me
. Em D/F# G         Asus  A    D
 'neath the healing, cleansing flood.

[V3]
.D                 G
 Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
. D      Bm         Em       A
 Just from sin and self to cease;
.D              G
 Just from Jesus simply taking
. Em D/F# G         Asus  A    D
 life and rest, and joy and peace.

.D                 G
 I'm so glad I learned to trust thee,
. D      Bm         Em       A
 Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
.D              G
 and I know that thou art with me,
. Em D/F# G         Asus  A D
 wilt be with me to the end.

[E]
. Em D/F# G       Asus   A   D
 O for grace to trust him more!</lyrics>
