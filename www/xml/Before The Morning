  <lyrics>[V1]
. A                          D                       F#m
 Do you wonder why you have to feel the things that hurt you?
.                     D         E
 If there's a God who loves you where is He now?||
. A                             D
 Or maybe there are things you can't see
.                         F#m                         D
 And all those things are happening to bring a better ending
. E                       D           E
 Someday, somehow you'll see, you'll see
 
 
[C1] 
 Would you dare, would you dare to believe
 That you still have a reason to sing?
 'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
 It can't compare to the joy that's coming||
 
 So hold on, you gotta wait for the light
 Press on and just fight the good fight
 'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
 It's just the dark before the morning
 
[V2]
. A                            A
 My friend, you know how this all ends
.                          F#m
 And you know where you're going
.                               D            E
 You just don't know how you'll get there so say a prayer||
 
 And hold on 'cause there's good for those who love God
 But life is not a snapshot, it might take a little time
 But you'll see the bigger picture
 
 
[B]
. A        B        C#m       D
 Once you feel the weight of glory
. A        B        C#m       D
 All your pain will fade to memory
. A        B        C#m       D
 Once you feel the weight of glory
. A        B        C#m       D                      E
 All your pain will fade to memory, memory, memory, yeah
 
 
[E]
. F#m               A
 Oh, the pain that you've been feeling
. D              E
 It's just the dark before the morning
