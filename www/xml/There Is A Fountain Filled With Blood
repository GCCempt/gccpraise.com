  <lyrics>[V1]
. A                    D2          A
 There is a fountain filled with blood,
.                       E
 Drawn from Immanuel's veins; ||
.     A              D2            A
 And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
.                E      A    
 Lose all their guilty stains||
.                E      D2           A                E
 Lose all their guilty stains;
 
 lose all their guilty stains;||
.     A               D2           A
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood,
.                E       D2
 Lose all their guilty stains.
 
[V2]
.A                D2          A
 The dying thief rejoiced to see, 
.                      E
 That fountain in his day; ||
.     A               D2     A
 And there have I, as vile as he,
.             E    A
 Washed all my sins away:||
.             E    D2         A           E
 Washed all my sins away, washed all my sins away; ||
.     A               D2     A
 And there may I, as vile as he,
.             E    D2
 Washed all my sins away.
 
[V3]
.      A               D2       A
 E'er since by faith I saw the stream, 
.                      E
 your flowing wounds supply,||
.      A                D2        A
 redeeming love has been my theme,
.             E      A
 and shall be till I die:||
.             E      D2        A              E
 and shall be till I die, and shall be till I die;||
.      A                D2        A
 redeeming love has been my theme, 
.             E      D2-A
 and shall be till I die.
 
[V4]
.      A               D2       A
 Then in a nobler, sweeter song, 
.                      E
 I'll sing your pow'r to save, ||
.      A                D2        A
 when this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue,
.             E      A
 lies silent in the grave:||
.             E      D2        A              E
 lies silent in the grave; lies silent in the grave; ||
.      A                D2        A
 when this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue, 
.             E      D2-A
 lies silent in the grave.
 
 
[V5]
.      A               D2       A
 Dear dying Lamb, your precious blood,
.                      E
 Shall never lose its pow'r, ||
.      A                D2        A
 Til' all the ransomed church of God
.             E      A
 Be saved to sin no more||
.             E      D2        A              E
 Be saved to sin no more,  be saved to sin no more ||
.      A                D2        A
 Till all the ransomed church of God
.             E      D2-A
 Be saved to sin no more.
