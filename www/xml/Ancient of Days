  <lyrics>[V1]
.            C   Am   G
 Though the nations rage
.          Dm       Am
 Kingdoms rise and fall ||
.           F        C/E
 There is still one King
.         Am D7  G 
 Reigning o-ver all ||
.      C   Am   G    C/E      F     G   Am
 So I will not fear for this truth remains:
.         F         Gsus  G     Csus  C
 That my God is the Ancient of Days
 
[C]
.       F                Am
 None above Him, none before Him
.        F       G    C
 All of time in His hands ||
.          F                Am            Gsus  G
 For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
.       F                Am
 All the power, all the glory ||
.        F       G    C
 I will trust in His name
.        F         Gsus  G    Csus  C
 For my God is the Ancient of Days
 
[V2]
.              C   Am   G
 Though the dread of night
.      Dm       Am
 Overwhelms my soul ||
.       F        C/E
 He is here with me
.      Am  D7  G 
 I am not alone ||
.       C   Am   G  C/E      F   G   Am
 O His love is sure and He knows my name
.        F         Gsus  G     Csus  C
 For my God is the Ancient of Days
 
 
[V3]
.         C   Am   G
 Though I may not see
.          Dm      Am
 What the future brings ||
.         F        C/E
 I will watch and wait
.         Am  D7   G 
 For the Saviour King ||
.         C   Am   G    C/E      F  G   Am
 Then my joy complete standing face to face
.         F             Gsus G     Csus  C
 In the presence of the Ancient of Days
 
 
[T]
.       F           Gsus G     Csus  C
 For my God is the Ancient of Days</lyrics>
