[V1]
.A
 You stood before creation
.D
 eternity in Your hand
.A/C#                     F#m
 You spoke the earth into motion
.            D
 My soul now to stand
 
 
[V2]
.A
 You stood before my failure
.    D
 And carried the cross for my shame
.   A/C#                      F#m
 My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
.            D
 My soul now to stand
 
 
[P1]
.                 D
 So what can I say
.Bm                 F#m
 And what could I do
.                    D     E
 But offer this heart O God
.        F#m            D
 Completely to You

[V3]
.   A
 So I'll walk upon salvation
.     D
 Your Spirit alive in me
.     A/C#                  F#m
 This life to declare Your promise
.            D
 My soul now to stand
 
[P2]
.                 D
 So what can I say
.Bm                 F#m
 And what could I do
.                    D     E
 But offer this heart O God
.        F#m            D
 Completely to You
 ||
.                 D
 So what can I say
.Bm                 F#m     A
 And what could I do
.                    D     E
 But offer this heart O God
.               D      A     E     F#m
 Completely to You
 
[C]
;The Chorus is repeated 5 times - the 4th time is acapella
.D         A
 So I'll stand
.     E             F#m            D
 With arms high and heart abandoned
.   A          E       F#m        D
 In awe of the One who gave it all  ||
.       A
 I'll stand
.    E           F#m
 My soul Lord to You surrendered
.D       A        E F#m
 All I am is Yours

[E]
. D       A        E F#m
 All I am is Yours
