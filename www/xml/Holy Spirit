.D    G2


[V1]
.D                                                   G2
 There's nothing worth more, That could ever come close
.                                        D                     
 No thing can compare, You're our living hope, 
.               G2
 Your Presence, Lord ||
.D                                         G2
 I've tasted and seen, Of the sweetest of loves, 
.                                             
 When my heart becomes free, 
.                  D
 And my shame is undone,
.                  G2
 Your Presence, Lord.

.      D
 Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for
.       G2                 Em7       D
 To be overcome by your presence, Lord
.               G2    Em7
 Your Presence, Lord

[V2]
.D                                                  G2
 There's nothing worth more, That could ever come close
.                                        D                     
 No thing can compare, You're our living hope,

 When my heart becomes free, And my shame is undone.
