  <lyrics>[V1]
.     G                               C9
 You dwell in the songs that we are singing
.               Em                      D
 Rising to the Heavens, rising to Your heart, Your heart
.      G                      C9
 Our praises filling up the spaces
.                Em                        D
 In between and frailty and everything You are
 
[P]
.             C9    Em     D
 You are the keeper of my heart
.             C9    Em     D
 You are the keeper of my heart
 
[C]
.         G             C9
 And I'm restless, I'm restless
.        Em                  D
 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You
.     G             C9
 I'm restless, I'm restless
.        Em                  D
 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You ||
 
 Oh God, I wanna rest in You
 
.     G                        C9
 Oh, speak now for my soul is listening
.                   Em                       D
 Say that You have saved me, whisper in the dark, the dark ||
.          G                         C9
 'Cause I know You're more than my salvation
.                  Em                   D
 Without You I'm hopeless, tell me who You are
 
 
[B]
.G                       C9
 Still my heart hold me close
.        Em                 D
 Let me hear a still small voice
.        G            C9
 Let it grow, let it rise
.        Em            D
 Into a shout, into a cry 
 (x2)
