; Intro:
.A D F#m E (x s 2)

[V1]
. A     E       F#m
 Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth
. E                    D
 Would care to know my name ||
. E/D               D
 Would care to feel my hurt ||
. A      E         F#m
 Who am I, that the bright and morning star
. E              D
 Would choose to light the way ||
. E/D               D
 For my ever wandering heart

[B]
. D            E
 Not because of who I am
. D                  E
 But because of what You've done ||
. F#m                E
 Not because of what I've done
. D        E
 But because of who You are

[C]
. A    E             F#m
 I am a flower quickly fading
. E                 D
 Here today and gone tomorrow ||
. E                  D
 A wave tossed in the ocean
.     D   E     A
 A vapor in the wind ||
. A         E          F#m
 Still You hear me when I'm calling
. E                       D
 Lord, You catch me when I'm falling ||
. E                  D
 And You've told me who I am
. A      D  F#m  E   A D F#m E
 I am Yours I am Yours

[V2]
. A          D#         F#m
 Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
. E                 D
 Would look on me with love ||
. E/D               D
 And watch me rise again ||
. A      E          F#m
 Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea
. E                  D
 Would call out through the rain ||
. E/D               D
 And calm the storm in me</lyrics>
