.      F#m            A                D                A  E/G#
 Oh... Oh... Oh..... Oh Oh Oh Oh   Oh... Oh... Oh..... Oh Oh Oh Oh
 
[V1]
. F#m           A
 Your innocence forsaken  
. F#m
 Upon that cross
. A                     D
 You gave Yourself for us
.        F#m       E
 Carried into Your freedom ||
. F#m            A
 Our broken past replaced in
. F#m
 A second chance
. A                      D
 The chains have come undone
.        F#m         E        D
 Death defied in the Father's love
 
[C]
.       A                        E
 We are living to make Your Name high, Jesus
. F#m                      E
 Living to make Your Name high, Jesus ||
. D                 F#m            E
 You gave what the world couldn't offer us
. D
 Say what they want Say what they want
.       F#m    A    D    A  E/G#
 We are free
.      F#m            A                D                A  E/G#
 Oh... Oh... Oh..... Oh Oh Oh Oh   Oh... Oh... Oh..... Oh Oh Oh Oh
 
[V2]
 The atmosphere is changing
 Oh can You hear
 The people rising up
 In the hope of Your freedom ||
 Our former ways are breaking
 We seek Your face
 God let Your kingdom come
 In our praises be lifted up
 
[B]
. D                E
 With eyes on high we praise You
. F#m               E
 And with one voice we come together
. D             E
 Our one desire to praise You
. F#m            E
 And lift You up in our surrender</lyrics></song>
