.G G C9 Am D G C D G

[V1]
.   Em          Bm              C
 Forgive my disobedience when I do as I please;
.   Am                                       C       B
 I confess my pride, my guilt, and doubts to You, oh God.||
.       Em              D               C
 Father speak to me and discipline. Ask me to obey.
.       Am                               C      C   D7
 Jesus, help me to lay down my life just as You did.

[C]
.                 G                           G
 The nails say it all; You were lashed with a scourge.
.        C9                          Am            D
 The Prince of Peace was spit on and shamed like a sinner;||
.    C           G            Cm
 You paid for it all, when we hated You.
.    G               C           D       G
 A thorny coronation crowned the Savior King.

[V2]
.   Em          Bm              C
 Now I know of all Your goodness Lord; I’ve tasted and seen.
.   Am                                       C       B
 You are so much more than any phrase could express.||
.       Em              D               C
 I am Yours now and forever, God; do as You will.
.       Am                               C      C D7
 I submit my life into Your hands for You are God.

[B]
.           Am
 You don’t have to speak for me to know
.    Em              D
 The extent of Your love.
.          Am                      D
 You don’t have to speak for me to know.

[E]

 A thorny coronation crowned the Savior King.
