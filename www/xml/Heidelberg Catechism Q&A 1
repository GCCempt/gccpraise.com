  <title>Heidelberg Catechism Q&amp;A 1</title>
  <lyrics> Q.(LEADER):  What is your only comfort in life and death?||
 A (CONGREGATION):  That I am not my own, but belong with body and soul, both in life and in death, to my faithful Savior Jesus Christ. ||
 He has fully paid for all my sins with His precious blood, and has set me free from all the power of the devil. ||
 He also preserves me in such a way that without the will of my heavenly Father not a hair can fall from my head; indeed, all things must work together for my salvation. ||
 Therefore, by His Holy Spirit He also assures me of eternal life and makes me heartily willing and ready from now on to live for Him.
