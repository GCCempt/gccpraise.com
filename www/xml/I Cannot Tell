  <title>I Cannot Tell</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.         Bb               Bb7/D    Eb        
 I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,
.              Bb/D   F/A     Bb/D    F   F7        
 Should set His love u-pon the sons of men, ||
.           Bb                 Bb7/D      Eb      Cm 
 Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wand’rers,
.  Ebm/Gb     Bb/F        Cm       F7     Bb   F7
 To bring them back, they know not how or when. ||
.           Bb        Eb      F      Gm  Cm F  Gm  Bb/F
 But this I know, that He was born of Mary,
.        D7/F# Gm      Eb        Bb/D    C7sus C7  F7
 When Bethl’hem’s manger was His only home, ||
.                 Bb  D7/F# Gm  Eb    Bb/F  Gm C7/G  
 And that He lived at Nazareth and labored,
. Ebm/Gb     Bb/F  Bb7/D  Eb  Bb/D  Cm  F7  Bb   
 And so the Savior, Savior of the world, is come.
 
 
[V2]
.         Bb               Bb7/D    Eb        
 I cannot tell how silently He suffered,
.              Bb/D   F/A     Bb/D    F   F7        
 As with His peace He graced this place of tears, ||
.           Bb                 Bb7/D      Eb      Cm 
 Or how His heart upon the Cross was broken,
.  Ebm/Gb     Bb/F        Cm       F7     Bb   F7
 The crown of pain to three and thirty years. ||
.        D7/F# Gm      Eb        Bb/D    C7sus C7  F7
 But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,
.        D7/F# Gm      Eb        Bb/D    C7sus C7  F7
 And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear, ||
.                 Bb  D7/F# Gm  Eb    Bb/F  Gm C7/G  
 And lifts the burden from the heavy laden,
. Ebm/Gb     Bb/F  Bb7/D  Eb  Bb/D  Cm  F7  Bb   
 For yet the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.
 
 
[V3]
.         Bb               Bb7/D    Eb        
 I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
.              Bb/D   F/A     Bb/D    F   F7        
 How He will claim His earthly heritage, ||
.           Bb                 Bb7/D      Eb      Cm 
 How satisfy the needs and aspirations
.  Ebm/Gb     Bb/F        Cm       F7     Bb   F7
 Of east and west, of sinner and of sage. ||
.        D7/F# Gm      Eb        Bb/D    C7sus C7  F7
 But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,
.        D7/F# Gm      Eb        Bb/D    C7sus C7  F7
 And He shall reap the harvest He has sown, ||
.                 Bb  D7/F# Gm  Eb    Bb/F  Gm C7/G  
 And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendor
. Ebm/Gb     Bb/F  Bb7/D  Eb  Bb/D  Cm  F7  Bb   
 When He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.
 
 
[V4]
.         Bb               Bb7/D    Eb        
 I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,
.              Bb/D   F/A     Bb/D    F   F7        
 When, at His bidding, every storm is stilled, ||
.           Bb                 Bb7/D      Eb      Cm 
 Or who can say how great the jubilation
.  Ebm/Gb     Bb/F        Cm       F7     Bb   F7
 When all the hearts of men with love are filled. ||
.        D7/F# Gm      Eb        Bb/D    C7sus C7  F7
 But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,
.        D7/F# Gm      Eb        Bb/D    C7sus C7  F7
 And myriad, myriad human voices sing, ||
.                 Bb  D7/F# Gm  Eb    Bb/F  Gm C7/G  
 And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:
. Ebm/Gb     Bb/F  Bb7/D  Eb  Bb/D  Cm  F7  Bb   
 At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King.
 
 
[E]
. Ebm/Gb     Bb/F  Bb7/D  Eb  Bb/D  Cm  F7  Bb   
 At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King.
