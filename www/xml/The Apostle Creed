  <lyrics>[V1]
 I believe in God the Father Almighty,
    Maker of heaven and earth.
 
[V2] 
 I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
    Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
    And born of the virgin Mary.||
    He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
    Was crucified, died, and was buried;
 
[V3]
    He descended into hell.
    The third day he rose again from the dead.
 
[V4]
    He ascended into heaven
    And is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,
    From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
 
[V5]
 I believe in the Holy Spirit,
    The holy catholic* church,
    The communion of saints,
    The forgiveness of sin,
    The resurrection of the body,
    And the life everlasting.          Amen.
  
[v6]
 *By “catholic” the Creed means the “universal” church of all true believers in all times and places.</lyrics></song>
