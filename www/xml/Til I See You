  <lyrics>[V1]
.           A          B                C#m
 The greatest love that anyone could ever know
.           A          B                C#m
 That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul ||
.           A          B                C#m
 And till I see you face to face, grace amazing takes me home
.              A
 I'll trust in you

[V2]
.             A             B              C#m
 With all I am I live to see Your kingdom come
.            A          B                   C#m
 And in my heart I pray You'd let Your will be done ||
.              A           B               C#m
 And till I see You face to face, grace amazing takes me home
.               A
 I'll trust in You

[C]
.        E      B
 I will live to love You
.   C#m           E
 I will live to bring You praise
.        A      B           C#m
 I will live a child in awe of You

[V3]
 With all I am I live to see Your kingdom come
 And in my heart I pray you'd let Your will be done ||
 And til I see you face to face, grace amazing takes me home
 I'll trust in you

[B]
.      A    E    B    C#m
 You alone are God of all
.   A     E    B      C#m
 You alone are worthy Lord
.     A      E          B       C#m        A
 And with all I am my soul will bless Your name</lyrics>
