.C            Am               Dm            G 
 Why have You chosen me out of millions Your child to be 
.    C            Am                 Dm   G 
 You know all the wrongs that I have done 
.   F             G             C        Am 
 Oh how could You pardon me, forgive my iniquities 
.   Dm           G          C   C7 
 To save me give Jesus Your son 


[C]
.    F            G           C          Am 
 Oh Lord help me be what You want me to be 
.     Dm          G          C   C7 
 Your word I will strive to obey 
.   F          G         C          Am 
 My life I now give, for You I will live 
.    Dm           G            C 
 And walk by Your side all the way 

[V2]
. C     Am                   Dm                 G 
 I am amazed to know that a God so great could love me so 
.    C           Am         Dm    G 
 He's willing and wanting to bless 
.   F          G              C        Am 
 His love is so wonderful, His mercy so bountiful 
. Dm         G             C    C7 
 I can't understand it I confess
