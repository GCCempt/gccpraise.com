  <lyrics>[V1]                              
.E                    F#m
 Over the mountains and the sea
.                         A
 Your river runs with love for me.
.                    B
 And I will open up my heart
.                     E
 And let the healer set me free.||
.                  F#m
 I'm happy to be in the truth
.                    A
 And I will daily lift my hands
.A
 For I will always sing
.    B
 Of when Your love came down.
 
[C]
.E                    F#m
 I could sing of your love forever.  
.     A                     B
 I could sing of your love forever.
.E                    F#m
 I could sing of your love forever.  
.     A                     B
 I could sing of your love forever. 
 
[C2]
.E                    F#m
 I could sing of your love forever.  
.     A                     B
 I could sing of your love forever.

[B]
.F#m            E/G#
 Oh I feel like dancing,
.A                   B
 It's foolishness I know.
.F#m                E/G#
 But when the world has seen the light,
.           A                       B
 They will dance with joy like we're dancing now.
 
[E]
 Everywhere I go I'm singing
 Every breath of air I'm breathing
 Everywhere I go I'll sing of
 When Your love came down
