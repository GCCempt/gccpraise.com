[V1] 
.B                                G#m 
 There is no height or depth 
 
 neither life nor death 
.               F#                          E 
 That can take me from all that I find 
.                       B 
 Here now in Your glory Lord 
 
[V2] 
. B                            G#m 
 No others powers or love 
 
 The things of now or to come 
.         F#                        E 
 There's nothing on earth in this life 
.                    B 
 That could ever separate us Lord 
 
[P] 
.   G#m                  F# 
 Your love is never ending 
.                       E 
 To Your hands we surrender 
.            B                 F#/A#    G#m   
 Where all our sins are washed away 
.                       F# 
 Your grace beyond reason 
.                      E 
 Has paid for our freedom 
.           G#m       F# 
 We're made alive in You 
---
 
[C] 
.     B 
 We run to Your throne 
.           F# 
 Where we belong 
.                     E 
 Every heart will sing 
.                     B 
 That Jesus is Lord . ||
 
 Casting all else aside 
.                      F# 
 For the joy of our Christ 
.                      E 
 Let Your glory fall 
.                                 B 
 Our hearts are filled with Your fire
