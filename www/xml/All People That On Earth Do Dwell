  <lyrics>[V1]
 All people that on earth do dwell,
 Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
 Him serve with fear, His praise forth-tell;
 Come ye before Him and rejoice.
 
[V2]
 The Lord ye know is God indeed;
 Without our aid He did us make;
 We are His folk, He doth us feed,
 And for His sheep He doth us take.
 
[V3]
 O enter then His gates with praise;
 Approach with joy His courts unto;
 Praise, laud, and bless His Name always,
 For it is seemly so to do.
 
[V4]
 For why? the Lord our God is good;
 His mercy is forever sure;
 His truth at all times firmly stood,
 And shall from age to age endure.</lyrics></song>
