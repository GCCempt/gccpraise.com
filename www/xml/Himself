[V1]
. E                         A              E
 Once it was the blessing, Now it is the Lord;
. E                       Bsus           B
 Once it was the feeling, Now it is His Word. ||
. A                  E     C#m            B
 Once His gifts I wanted, Now the Giver own;
. A                E/G#     B              E
 Once I sought for healing, Now Himself alone.

[V2]
.  E                         A                 E
 Once ’twas painful trying, Now it's perfect trust;

 Once a half salvation, Now the uttermost. ||

 Once ’twas ceaseless holding, Now He holds me fast;

 Once ’twas constant drifting, Now my anchor's cast.
 
 
[V3]
.  E                        A                 E

 Once ’twas anxious caring, Now He has the care. ||

 Once ’twas what I wanted, Now what Jesus says;

 Once ’twas constant asking, Now it's ceaseless praise.
 
 
[V4]
. E                       A                  E
 Once it was my working, His it hence shall be;
. E                        Bsus            B
 Once I tried to use Him, Now He lives in me. ||
. A               E/G#  E    C#m             B
 Once the power I want - ed, Now the Mighty One;
. A               E/G#    Bsus      B     E
 Once for self I labored, Now for Him alone.
