[V1]
.              C                 G
 How great the chasm that lay between us
.             F           Am          G
 How high the mountain I could not climb ||
.        C                  G
 In desperation I turned to heaven
.               F      G       C
 And spoke your name into the night ||
.                  F                    C
 Then through the darkness your loving kindness
.                  Am            G
 Tore through the shadows of my soul ||
.              C                   G
 The work is finished, the end is written
.        F         G      C
 Jesus Christ, my living hope
 
 
[V2]
.            C                 G
 Who could imagine so great a mercy
.                  F     Am                G
 What heart could fathom  such boundless grace ||
.            C                      G
 The God of Ages stepped down from glory
.           F        G       C
 To wear my sin and bear my shame ||
.               F             C
 The cross has spoken I am forgiven
.            Am                 G
 The King of Kings calls me His own ||
.          C                   G
 Beautiful Savior, I’m yours forever
.       F          G      C
 Jesus Christ, my living hope
 
 
[C1]
.     F  C              G              Am
 Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
.     F  C             G               Am
 Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me ||
.         F             C                G              Am
 You have broken every chain there’s salvation in your name
.       F         G      C
 Jesus Christ, my living hope
 
 
[V3]
.              C                       G
 Then came the morning that sealed the promise
.            F    Am          G
 Your buried body    began to breathe ||
.           C                   G
 Out of the silence the Roaring Lion
.              F            G        C
 Declared the grave has no claim on me ||
 
.              C                       G
 Then came the morning that sealed the promise
.            F    Am          G
 Your buried body   began to breathe ||
.           C                   G
 Out of the silence the Roaring Lion
.             F            G        Am  C/E
 Declare the grave has no claim on me ||
.      F            G    C
 Jesus, Yours is the victory
 
 
[C2]
.     F  C              G              Am
 Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
.     F  C             G               Am
 Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me ||
.         F             C                G              Am
 You have broken every chain, there’s salvation in your name
.      F         G      Am   C/E
 Jesus Christ, my living hope ||
.      F         G      Am   C/E
 Jesus Christ, my living hope
.        F       G      C
 God, You are my living hope
