  <lyrics>[V1]
 I see the sparrow fall from the sky
 These little creatures cannot escape my eye ||
 You are more precious than these creatures of the air
 So tell me then why would you doubt
 My tender love and care?
 
[C]
 Rest in me, rest in me 
 I am your father
 You’re my precious child
 Be still before me
 Wait on me a while
 And rest in me
 
[V2]
 My thoughts about you outnumber grains of sand
 I hold you safely in the hollow of my hand ||
 I have even numbered all the hairs upon your head
 And sent my son to love you with
 The precious blood he shed
 
[B]
 In quietness and rest will be your strength
 If you will just be still
 Won’t you let me come and fill
 Your anxious heart
;Read Psalm 139
 
[E]
 Rest in me</lyrics></song>
