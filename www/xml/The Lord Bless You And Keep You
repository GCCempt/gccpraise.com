  <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord bless you and keep you;
 The Lord make His face to shine upon you 
 To shine upon you and be gracious
 And be gracious unto you ;
 
[V2]
 The Lord bless you and keep you;​
 The Lord make His face to shine upon you​
 To shine upon you and be gracious​
 And be gracious unto you; 
 
[V3]
 The Lord lift up the light ​
 Of His countenance upon you,​
 The Lord lift up the light ​
 Of His countenance upon you,
 
[V4]
 And give you peace and give you peace​
 And give you peace and give you peace .​
 Amen​
