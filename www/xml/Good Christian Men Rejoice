. D         Bm      G   A7
 Good Christian men, rejoice
.       D         Bm         G    A7
 With heart and soul and voice;
.D       F#m      A      Bm
 Give ye heed to what we say:
. Em    A         Bm     D  
 Jesus Christ is born today:||
. D     F#m    A        Bm
 Earth and Heaven before Him bow,

 And He is in the manger now.

 Christ is born today!
 
[V2]
 Good Christian men, rejoice
 With heart and soul and voice;
 Now ye hear of endless bliss;
 Jesus Christ was born for this!||
 He hath opened heav-en's door
 And man is blessed evermore.
 Christ was born for this!
 Christ was born for this!
 
[V3]
 Good Christian men, rejoice
 With heart and soul and voice;
 Now ye need not fear the grave;
 Jesus Christ was born to save!||
 Calls you one and calls you all
 To gain his everlasting hall.
 Christ was born to save!
 Christ was born to save! </lyrics></song>
