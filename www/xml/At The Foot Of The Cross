  <lyrics>[V1]
. B                  C#m
 At the foot of the cross
.       A                      E
 Where grace and suffering meet
.B                     C#m
 You have shown me Your love
.             A                   B
 Through the judgment You received ||
.           F#m   E/G#  A  B
 And You've won my  heart
.           F#m   E/G#  A  A2/B
 Yes You've won my  heart      Now I Can
 
[C1]
.E            B            F#m   E
 Trade these ashes in for beauty
.E             B               F#m
 And wear forgiveness like a crown
.E          B                  F#m
 Coming to kiss the feet of mercy
.       C#m   B      F#m
 I lay every burden down
.        B           E
 At the foot of the cross
 
[V2]
. B                  C#m
 At the foot of the cross
.      A            E
 Where I am made complete
.B                    C#m
 You have given me life
.             A                 B
 Through the death You bore for me ||
.           F#m   E/G#  A  B
 And You've won my  heart
.           F#m   E/G#  A  A2/B
 Yes You've won my  heart      Now I Can
