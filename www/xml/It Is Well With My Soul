[V1]
.     E                    A  B        E
 When peace like a river attendeth my way,
. C#m          F#          B
 When sorrows like sea billows roll;||
.    E       A              F#           B
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
.       E           A    B        E
 “It is well, it is well with my soul.”
 
[C]
.      E            B
 It is well, (it is well,)
.        B              E
 With my soul, (with my soul,)
.      A           E    B       E
 It is well, it is well with my soul.
 
[V2]
.       E                           A     B        E
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
.C#m          F#         B
 Let this blest assurance control, ||
.     E            A         F#        B
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
.      E            A     B      E
 And hath shed his own blood for my soul.

[V3]
.   E                         A    B    E
 My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought!
.C#m         F#           B
 My sin, not in part but the whole
.   E             A            F#         B
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
.E                A     B    E
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
 
[V4]
.     E                           A      B        E
 O Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
.C#m              F#        B
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll; ||
.    E             A              F#           B
 The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
.E         A    B       E
 Even so, it is well with my soul.</lyrics>
