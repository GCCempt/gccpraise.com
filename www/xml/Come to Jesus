[V1]
 G
 Weak and wounded sinner,  
 D
 Lost and left to die,  
 Am		       C	           D 
 O, raise your head for Love is passing by, 
 
 
[C]
 	   G 
 Come to Jesus, 
 	   C 
 Come to Jesus, 
 	 G D	  G 
 Come to Jesus and live, 
 
[V2]
 G 
 Now your burden's lifted, 
 D
 And carried far away,  
 Am			C		     D
 And precious blood has washed away the stain... so 
 
 
[C2]
 	   G
 Sing to Jesus , 
 	   C
 Sing to Jesus , 
        G  D      G
 Sing to Jesus and live, 
 
 (Same progression, move to the key of C)
 
 
[V3]
 G#
 And like a newborn baby, 
 D#
 Don't be afraid to crawl, 
 A#m                   C#                  D#
 And remember when you walk sometimes we fall... so 
 
[C3]
           G#
 Fall on Jesus, 
           C#
 Fall on Jesus,  
        G#  D#     G#
 Fall on Jesus and live, 
 
[V4]
 G#
 Sometimes the way is lonely, 
 D#
 And steep and filled with pain, 
 A#m               C#                    D#
 So if your sky is dark and pours the rain... then 
 
           
[C4]
          G#
 Cry to Jesus, 
 	  C#
 Cry to Jesus, 
       G#  D#      G#
 Cry to Jesus and live, 
 
 
 (Same progression, move to the key of D, transition by playing an A before 
 going to A#) 
 
[V5]
 A# 
 O, and when the love spills over, 
 F
 And music fills the night, 
 Cm                D#                   F
 And when you can't contain you joy inside... then 
 
[C5]
             A#
 Dance for Jesus, 
             D#
 Dance for Jesus, 
          A#  F      A#
 Dance for Jesus and live, 
 
[V6]
 A#
 And with your final heartbeat, 
 F
 Kiss the world goodbye, 
 Cm                    D#                 F
 Then go in peace, and laugh on Glory's side... and 
 
 
[C6]
          A#
 Fly to Jesus, 
          D#
 Fly to Jesus, 
       A#  F       A#
 Fly to Jesus and live, 
 
 
[C6]
          A#
 Fly to Jesus, 
          D#
 Fly to Jesus, 
       A#  F       A#
 Fly to Jesus and live,
