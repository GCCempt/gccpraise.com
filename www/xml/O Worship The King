  <lyrics>[V1]
 O worship the King, all glorious above,
 O gratefully sing His power and His love;||
 Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
 Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.

[V2]
 O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
 Whose robe is the light, Whose canopy space,||
 His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
 And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

[V3]
 The earth with its store, of wonders untold,
 Almighty, your pow'r, hath founded of old;||
 Has 'stablished it fast by a changeless decree,
 And round it has cast, like a mantle, the sea.

[V4]
 Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
 It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;||
 It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
 And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

[V5]
 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
 In you do we trust, nor find you to fail;||
 Your mercies how tender, how firm to the end,
 Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.

[V6]
 O measureless might! Ineffable Love!
 While angels delight to hymn you above,||
 The humbler creation, though feeble their lays,
 With true adoration shall lisp to your praise.

[C]
 Hosanna! Hosanna! Forever we’ll worship the King.
 Hosanna! Hosanna! Forever we’ll worship the King.||
 Hosanna! Hosanna! Forever we’ll worship the King
 Hosanna! Hosanna! Forever we’ll worship the King

[B]
 He is the King, He is the Lord
 He is the One who delivers me||
 He is the King, He is the Lord
 He is the One who delivers me ||

 Hail to the King, Hail to the Lord
 Hail to the One who delivers me ||
 Hail to the King, Hail to the Lord
 Hail to the One who delivers me

[T]
 Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.</lyrics>
