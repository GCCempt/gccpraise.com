  <title>Let Others See Jesus In You</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 
.       G                     C 
 While passing through this world of sin
.     G           A          D
 And others your life shall view
.       G                     C 
 Be clean and pure without within
.       G         D       G 
 Let others see Jesus in you


[C]
.     G                   D 
 Let others see Jesus in you
.      D                  G
 Let others see Jesus in you
.      C                     G
 Keep telling the story be faithful and true
.     G           D      G
 Let others see Jesus in you


[V2]
.       G               C  
 Your life's a book before their eyes
.          G           A          D
 They're reading it through and through
.      G                 C
 Say does it point them to the skies
.     G           D      G
 Do others see Jesus in you


[V3]
.       G               C  
 What joy 'twill be at set of sun
.     G          A       D
 In mansions beyond the blue
.     G                   C
 To find some souls that you have won
.     G           D      G
 Let others see Jesus in you


[V4]
.       G                   C  
 Then live for Christ both day and night
.     G           A         D
 Be faithful be brave and true
.      G               C
 And lead the lost to life and light
.     G           D      G
 Let others see Jesus in you
