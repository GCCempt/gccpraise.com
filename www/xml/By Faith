  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                   D/A     A     Amaj7  D/A
 By faith we see the hand of God 
.        A       F#m7                Asus   A/C
 In the light of creation's grand design ||
.       D     F#m E/G#  A   F#m   E   D   E   F#m
 In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness 
.D2                     E      A      D/A
 Who walk by faith and not by sight 
 
[V2]
.A                     D/A        A     Amaj7  D/A
 By faith our fathers roamed the earth 
.          A           F#m7             Asus    A/C
 With the power of His promise in their hearts ||
.     D F#m E/G# A  F#m E D    E   F#m
 Of a holy city built by God's own hand

 A place where peace and justice reign 
 
[C]
.A                     D/A        A     Amaj7  D/A
 We will stand as children of the promise 
.          A           F#m7             Asus    A/C
 We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward ||
.       D     F#m E/G#  A   F#m   E   D   E   F#m
 Till the race is finished and the work is done 
.D2                      E        A      D/A
 We'll walk by faith and not by sight 
 
[V3]
.A                     D/A    A     Amaj7  D/A
 By faith the prophets saw a day 
.          A                  F#m7    Asus   A/C
 When the longed-for Messiah would appear ||
.         D     F#m E/G#  A   F#m   E   D   E   F#m
 With the power to break the chains of sin and death 
.D2                   E        A      D/A
 And rise triumphant from the grave 
 
[V4]
.A                        D/A      A     Amaj7  D/A
 By faith the church was called to go 
.        A                  F#m7    Asus   A/C
 In the power of the Spirit to the lost ||
.      D F#m E/G# A  F#m  E  D      E   F#m
 To deliver captives and to preach good news 
.D2              E        A      D/A
 In every corner of the earth 
 
[V5]
.A                        D/A      A     Amaj7  D/A
 By faith this mountain shall be moved 
.        A            F#m7            Asus   A/C
 And the power of the gospel shall prevail ||
.         D  F#m  E/G#  A   F#m    E  D  E  F#m
 For we know in Christ all things are possible 
.D2                E        A      D/A
 For all who call upon His name
