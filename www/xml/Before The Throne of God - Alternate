  <title>Before The Throne of God - Alternate</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                     F    C
 Before the throne of God above
.C                        Em
 I have a strong, and perfect plea
.             F        C      G     Am
 A great High Priest, whose name is Love,
.         F                    C
 Who ever lives and pleads for me.
 ||
.            F             C
 My name is graven on his hands,
.            F             Am
 My name is written on his heart;
.            F        G         Am 
 I know that while in heaven he stands
.               F              Am
 No tongue can bid me thence depart
.               F               C 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.
 
 
[V2]
.C                    F    C    
 When Satan tempts me to despair,
.C                        Em
 And tells me of the guilt within,
.          F        C    G   Am
 Upward I look, and see him there
.          F              C
 Who made an end of all my sin.

.              F            C 
 Because a sinless Savior died,
.             F             Am
 My sinful soul is counted free;
.              F         G   Am
 For God, the Just, is satisfied
.        F                 C
 To look on Him and pardon me
.        F                 C
 To look on Him and pardon me
 
 
[C]
.G              Em   Am             
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
.   F
 Praise the One,
.      G       C
 Risen Son of God!
 
 
[V3]
.C                      F     C
 Behold him there, the risen Lamb
.C                              Em
 My perfect, spotless righteousness,
.             F  C  G     Am
 The great unchangeable I am,
.              F            C
 The King of glory and of grace!
 
 ||
.           F             C
 One in himself, I cannot die
.            F                Am
 My soul is purchased by his blood
.            F        G         Am 
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
.                  F           Am
 With Christ, my Savior and my God
.                  F            C 
 With Christ, my Savior and my God
 
[E]
.           F             C
 One in himself, I cannot die
.            F                Am
 My soul is purchased by his blood
.            F        G         Am 
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
.                  F           Am
 With Christ, my Savior and my God
.                  F            C 
 With Christ, my Savior and my God</lyrics>
