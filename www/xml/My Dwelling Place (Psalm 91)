  <title>My Dwelling Place (Psalm 91)</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.    A                 D        A 
 My dwelling place is God Most High
.    A             A/E  E
 My refuge and my fortress
.      A               D          A
 When plague and pestilence draw nigh
.     A             E   A
 I’m hidden in His presence
.      E                A
 When terrors fall and arrows fly
.      D                A/E  E
 His shield will be my safety
.       A               D       A 
 When stones across my pathway lie
.     A                E   A
 On angels’ wings I’m carried
 
 
[V2]
.    A                 D        A 
 My dwelling place is God Most High
.    A              A/E  E
 A present help in danger
.    A               D          A
 I rest secure in Love’s pure light
.     A               E  A
 Beneath My Master’s favor
.      E                A
 He freed me from the fowler’s snare
.        D                 A/E  E
 Where sin and shame had bound me
.    A                 D     A 
 Deceived I made my refuge there
.       A               E   A
 Till fearless He came for me
 
 
[B]
. E         A           E              A    
 Wonderful powerful my hope and my defender
. E           F#m E/G# A    D               E  A    
 Mighty God E-mman-u-el my dwelling place forever
 
 
[V3]
.    A                 D        A 
 My dwelling place is God Most High
.       A         A/E  E
 I’ll never seek another
.     A            D      A
 For I am His and He is mine
.     A                 E  A
 My heart He’ll keep forever
.    E               A
 I know the Name on Whom I call
.       D       A/E  E
 He promises to answer
.       A           D       A 
 With life he satisfies my soul
.      A                  E   A
 And crowns me with his pleasure
 
 
[B]
. E         A           E              A    
 Wonderful powerful my hope and my defender
. E           F#m E/G# A    D               E  A    
 Mighty God E-mman-u-el my dwelling place forever
 
 
[E]
. E           F#m E/G# A    D               E  A    
 Mighty God E-mman-u-el my dwelling place forever</lyrics>
