.D 
 There's a cry in my heart
 
.A
 For your glory to fall
 
.Em                           Asus  A
 For your presence to fill up my senses||
 
.D
 There's a yearning again
 
.A
 A thirst for discipline
 
.Em                              Asus  A
 A hunger for things that are deeper
 
 
[B]
 
.Bm                  G 
 Could you take me beyond
 
.D                     A
 Could you carrry me through
 
.Bm                G
 If I opened my heart
 
.D                     A
 Could I go there with you||
 
.Bm                    G
 For I've been here before
 
.D                         A
 Yet I know there's still more
 
.Em                      A
 O Lord, I need to know you
 
 
[C]
.                G
 For what do I have
 
.                     D
 If I don't have you Jesus
 
.               A
 What in this life
 
.               Bm
 Could mean anymore||
 
.            G
 You are my rock
 
.              D
 You are my glory
 
.              A        G    Bm
 You are the lifter of my head
