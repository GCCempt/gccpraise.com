  <lyrics>[V1]
 Angels from the realms of glory
 Wing your flight over all the earth; ||
 Ye who sang creation’s story
 Now proclaim Messiah’s birth
 
[V2]
 Shepherds, in the fields abiding
 Watching o'er your flocks by night ||
 God with man is now residing
 Yonder shines the infant Light
 
[C]
 Come and worship, come and worship
 Worship Christ, the newborn King
 
[V3]
 Sages, leave your contemplations,
 Brighter visions beam afar; ||
 see the great Desire of nations;
 ye have seen his natal star:
 
[V4]
 Saints before the altar bending,
 watching long in hope and fear, ||
 suddenly the Lord, descending
 in his temple shall appear:
 
[V5]
 All creation, join in praising
 God, the Father, Spirit, Son ||
 Evermore your voices raising
 To th'eternal Three in One </lyrics>
