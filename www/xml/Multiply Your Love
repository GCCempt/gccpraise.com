 Help me Lord to freely give, this grace that I’ve received

 Through my simple words and deeds, let love be multiplied

 Multiply Your Church through us, to the ends of the earth 
 Where there’s only barrenness, let us see new birth 
 Use us as Your laborers, working side by side 
 Let us see Your harvest come, let love be multiplied

 Let love be multiplied in my life Let love be multiplied
