[I]
.G       C  (2x)

[V1]
.           G
 Come and stand before your Maker
.         C
 Full of wonder, full of fear
.        G
 Come behold His power and glory
.          C
 Yet with confidence draw near ||
.        Em
 For the one who holds the heavens
.        D
 And commands the stars above
.        C
 Is the God who bends to bless us
.         D
 With an unrelenting love


[C1]
.   G               Em
 Rejoice, come and lift your hands and
.  C         G            Em             C
 Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise
.   Em             C
 Rejoice, sing of mercies of your King
.           Em    D      G      
 And with trembling, rejoice


[V2] 

 We are children of the promise
 The beloved of the Lord
 Won with everlasting kindness
 Bought with sacrificial blood ||
 Bringing reconciliation
 To a world that longs to know
 The affections of a Father
 Who will never let them go


[V3]

 All our sickness, all our sorrows
 Jesus carried up the hill
 He has walked this path before us
 He is walking with us still ||
 Turning tragedy to triumph
 Turning agony to praise
 There is blessing in the battle
 So take heart and stand amazed

[C2]
.   G/B             C
 Rejoice, when you cry to Him He hears
.      G/B            C
 Your voice, He will wipe away your tears
.   Em            C
 Rejoice, in the midst of suffering
.         Em       D
 He will help you sing
