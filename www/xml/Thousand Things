  <lyrics>[V1]
.C               F               C    F
 As the Sun comes up, Lord I see You
 As the wind blows on my face, Lord I feel You
 
[P1]
.G		 	D            F       C  
 Sometimes I don't know what to say when my heart wants to praise
.G           D                    F               G              F
 and I have concluded of You that I barely know anything about You at all
 
[C]
.F                   C          F       G 
 Cuz Lord if You showed me a thousand things 
.G           C         F     G 
 brand new about You everyday
.                 Am          F           G     F
 I still would never see the fullness of Your glory ||
 Lord if You gave me a thousand years
 to try and count up all the ways that You have shown to me
 that You are just not enough, You are too much
 
[V2]
 As the river flows, Lord I hear You
 As the rain falls on my face, Lord I feel You
 
[P2]
 I know You know me better then I know myself
 but I want to know You even though I know my mind can't hold it all</lyrics></song>
