[V1]
.F                   C                         Am                            
 From the birds that sing, in the tallest trees.
.             G                  F
 To the human life, of you and me. ||
.                C                           Am
 From the desert sands, to the place we stand.
.                 G                Am        B
 He is God of all, He is everything.         Ohhhh
 
[C]
.C                                      G                             Am
 I'm giving my life to the only one who makes the moon reflect the sun.
.                    F
 Every starry night..... that was His design. ||
.C                                       G                         Am
 I'm giving my life to the only Son, who was and is and yet to come
.                      F                        C
 Let the praises ring.... cause he is everything
.F                     C          F
 Cause he is everything
 
[V2]
.F                  C                             Am                 
 From the autumn leaves, that will ride the breeze
.                  G                 F
 To the faith it takes, to pray and sing ||
.                 C                          Am
 From the painted sky, to my plank filled eye
.                  G                  Am         B
 He is God of all,    He is everything           Ohhhh

[B]
.Am          F           C            G
 Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Hallelujah   I believe  Ohhhhh
.Am          F           C            G
 Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Hallelujah   I believe  
 
[C2]
.C                                      G                             Am
 I'm giving my life to the only one who makes the moon reflect the sun.
.                    F
 Every starry night..... he changed my life. ||
.C                                       G                         Am
 I'm giving it all to the only Son, who gave me hope when I had none
.                      F                        C
 So let the praises ring.... let the praises ring
 
 
[E]
.C                                      G                             Am
 I'm giving my life to the only one who makes the moon reflect the sun.
.                    F
 Every starry night..... that was his design. ||
.C                                       G                         Am
 I'm giving my life to the only Son, who was and is and yet to come
.                      F                        C
 let the angels sing.... that he is heaven's king
.                      F                        C
 So Let the praises ring.... cause he is everything </lyrics></song>
