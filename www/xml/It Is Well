  <lyrics>;Intro:
.G  D  Em 

[V1]
.G                  D        Em
 Grander earth has quaked before
.G              D           Em
 Moved by the sound of His voice
.G              D          Em
 Seas that are shaken and stirred
.G                            D     Em
 Can be calmed and broken for my regard


[C]
.            C               D 
 Through it all, through it all
.    Em
 My eyes are on You
.            C               D
 Through it all, through it all
.       Em
 It is well ||
.            C               D
 Through it all, through it all
.    Em
 My eyes are on You
.      Dsus4  D
 It is well    with me

;Instrumental
.G  D  Em 


[V2]
.    G               D      Em     
 Far be it for me to not believe
.G             D         Em
 Even when my eyes can't see
.         G                   D       Em
 And this mountain that's in front of me
.         G               D       Em
 Will be thrown into the midst of sea



[B]
.       G      D        Em      C
 So let go my soul and trust in Him
.               G          D        Em   C
 The waves and wind still know His name
.       G      D        Em      C
 So let go my soul and trust in Him
.               G          D        Em   C
 The waves and wind still know His name ||

.       G      D        Em      C
 So let go my soul and trust in Him
.               G          D        Em   C
 The waves and wind still know His name
.               G          D        Em
 The waves and wind still know His name


[T]
.       C        D   Em
 It is well with my soul
.       C        D   Em
 It is well with my soul
.       C        D   Em
 It is well with my soul
.C                 Dsus D        Em
 It is well, it is well with my soul

[E]
.       C           D            Em
 It is well, it is well with my soul
.       C           D            G
 It is well, it is well with my soul
