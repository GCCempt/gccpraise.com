  <lyrics>; DO NOT USE THIS SONG PER KEN: I've gotten some feedback about our selection of "My Best Friend."  
;I take responsibility for that, since I reviewed and approved the song.  
;The feeling is that it is a little too "familiar" (i.e., not reverential enough) in the way it addresses God.  
;Not that the Lord isn't a friend to his people, but I think that, in this day and age, we tend too much toward bringing God down to our level and not enough toward focusing on his "otherness" and majesty in worship.
