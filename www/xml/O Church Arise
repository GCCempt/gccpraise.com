  <lyrics>[V1]
.  A7sus4     D                G/B     A/C#
 O Church, arise, and put your armour on;
.         D/F#    G          Asus4 A D
 hear the call of Christ our Captain.||
.    A7sus4   D                G/B      A/C#
 For now the weak can say that they are strong
.        D/F#         G    Asus4 A D
 in the strength that God has given. ||
.      D/F#     G         D/F#    A
 With shield of faith and belt of truth,
.      D/F#     G        D/F# Bm  A
 we'll stand against the devil's lies;||
.   A7sus4  D               G/B    A/C#
 an army bold, whose battle cry is Love,
.         D/F#   G        Asus4  A D  Dsus4  D
 reaching out to those in darkness.
 
 
[V2]
.   A7sus4    D               G/B     A/C#
 Our call to war, to love the captive soul
.       D/F#    G         Asus4 A D
 But to rage against the captor;||
.    A7sus4   D                    G/B      A/C#
 And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,
.        D/F#         G       Asus4 A D
 We will fight with faith and valour. ||
.      D/F#     G          D/F#   A
 When faced with trials on every side
.    D/F#     G      D/F# Bm  A
 We know the outcome is secure,||
.    A7sus4      D                   G/B     A/C#
 And Christ will have the prize for which He died,
.    D/F#   G        Asus4  A D  Dsus4  D
 An inheritance of nations.

[V3]
 Come see the cross, where love and mercy meet,
 
 As the Son of God is stricken;||
 
 Then see His foes, lie crushed beneath His feet,
 
 For the Conqueror has risen! ||
 
 And as the stone is rolled away,
 
 And Christ emerges from the grave,||
 
 This victory march continues till the day
 
 Every eye and heart shall see Him.
 
 
[V4]
 
 So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride,
 
 Give grace for every hurdle,||
 
 That we may run with faith to win the prize
 
 Of a servant good and faithful.||
 
 As saints of old still line the way,
 
 Retelling triumphs of His grace,||
 
 We hear their calls, and hunger for the day
 
 When with Christ we stand in glory.</lyrics>
