.D                               G                    D
 I've had just enough of the spotlight, when it burns bright
.Dsus2                         Asus4        A 
 To see how it gets in the blood || 
.D
   And I've tasted my share of the sweet life, and the wild ride
.Dsus2                    Asus4        A
   And found a little is not quite enough
.    Dsus2
 I know how I can stray
.        Dsus2
 And how fast my heart could change
 
[C1]
.       D
 Empty me
.       G
 Of the selfishness inside
.       Bm      A            G
 Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride ||
.        D                G
 And any foolish thing my heart holds to 
.       Bm         A                  G
 Lord empty me  so I can be filled with you
 
[V2]
.D                               G                    D
   I've seen just enough of the quick buys, of the best lies
.Dsus2                         Asus4        A
   To know how prodigals could be drawn away
.                   Dsus2
 I know how I can stray
.        Dsus2
 And how fast my heart could change
 
 
[B]
.          Bm            A              G               G
 Cause everything is a lesser thing compared to you, compared to you
.          Bm            A              G                      (solo)D  G  D
 Cause everything is a lesser thing compared to you so I surrender all||
 
 Empty me Of the selfishness inside
 
 Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride
 
[C2]
       D
 Empty me
       G
 Of the selfishness inside
       Bm      A            G
 Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride
        D                G
 And any foolish thing my heart holds to ||
       Bm         A                  G
 Lord empty me  so I can be
       Bm         A              G               D       G
 Lord empty me something so I can be filled with you
             D      G
 Filled with you
       D
