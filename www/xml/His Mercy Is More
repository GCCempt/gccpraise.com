  <title>His Mercy Is More</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.     D                      G              D
 What love could remember no wrongs we have done
.   A              Bm         G               A
 Omniscient, all knowing, he counts not their sum
 ||
.       D    Em            D/F#        G
 Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
.D/F# G2            D/A       A          D
 Our  sins they are many, his mercy is more
 
[V2]
. D                       G                D
 What patience would wait as we constantly roam
.      A          Bm         G         A
 What father, so tender, is calling us home
 ||
.       D        Em           D/F#        G
 He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
.D/F# G2            D/A       A          D
 Our  sins they are many, his mercy is more
 
[C]
.D          G D Bm
 Praise the Lord
.    A        G D A
 His mercy is more ||
.G             D           A/C#    Bm7
 Stronger than darkness, new every morn
.G                 D          A         D
 Our sins they are many, his mercy is more
 
[V3]
.     D                      G          D
 What riches of kindness he lavished on us
.    A             Bm           G            A
 His blood was the payment, his life was the cost
 ||
.    D            Em             D/F#  G
 We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford
.D/F# G2            D/A       A          D
 Our  sins they are many, his mercy is more
 
 
[E]
.G                 D          A         D
 Our sins they are many, his mercy is more
