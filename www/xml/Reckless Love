.Em D C G


[V1]
.Em                  D                       C
   Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me. 
.Em               D              C
   You have been so, so good to me. ||
.Em                 D                          C
   Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me. 
.Em               D              C
   You have been so, so kind to me. 

[C]
.       Em            D             C                G
 Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
.       Em              D                       C                 G
 Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine. ||
.           Em               D                      C             G
 I couldn't earn it. I don't deserve it. Still, You give yourself away. 
.       Em            D             C                G
 Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God


[V2]
.Em                  D                    C
   When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me. 
.Em               D              C
   You have been so, so good to me. ||
.Em                 D                  C
   When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me. 
.Em               D              C
   You have been so, so kind to me.


[B] 
.Em
 There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me. ||
.Em
 There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.</lyrics>
