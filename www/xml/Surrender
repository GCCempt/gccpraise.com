  <lyrics>[V1]
. D       C          G                    
 Holy Father, as we stand before Your throne
.       Em
 As we look upon Your face
.       C                    A
 We confess Your matchless grace||
.          D   C            G               
 Lord and Savior, we have nothing without You
.  Em
 There is nothing we can do
.      C                  A 
 But to serve and follow You
 
[C]
.     D
 And surrender
.     G
 And surrender
.     D
 To surrender||
. G    
 All our dreams
. Em
 All we are
.             C         G
 All that we are to become
.          D
 All our love
--- 
[E]
.           G                           
  All our Love, 
.        D
 all our love, 
.        G
 All our love  
. Em
 All we are
.              C       G
 All that we are to become
.          D
 All our love </lyrics>
