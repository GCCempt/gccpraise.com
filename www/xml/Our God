;INTRO:
.Em C G D

[V1]
.Em                  C     G
 Water you turned into wine
.Em                 C        G
 opened the eyes of the blind
.                       Am
 there’s no one like you
.             D
 none like you

[V2]
.Em              C          G
 Into the darkness you shine
.Em                C     G
 out of the ashes we rise
.                        Am
 there is no one like you
.             D
 none like you

[C]
.Em
 Our God is greater
.C
 Our God is stronger
.G                                   D
 God you are higher than any other ||
---
.Em
 Our God is Healer
.C
 Awesome in power
.G               D
 Our God, Our God

[B]
.Em
 and if our God is for us
.C
 then who could ever stop us
.G
 and if our God is with us
.D
 then what could stand against

[T]
.C         G
 So I'll stand
.     D             Em             C
 With arms high and heart abandoned
.   G          D       Em         C
 In awe of the One who gave it all ||
.       G
 I'll stand
.    D           Em
 My soul Lord to You surrendered
.C       G        D Em
 All I am is Yours

[E]
