[V1]
.Bm     G              D
  The passion of our Saviour
.Bm     G          D    A/C#
  The mercy of our God

  The cross that leaves no question

 Our chains are gone

 The cross has overthrown the grave

 And life for me

  While the guilty one walks free
.Bm  G                   D
    Death would be His portion

 And our portion liberty

  He is risen

 And life for me
