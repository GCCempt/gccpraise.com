  <lyrics>;Intro
. E A

[V1]
. E                     B      C#m A
 If love endured that ancient cross
. E                   B       C#m  A
 How precious is my Saviour’s blood
. E                     B            C#m A
 The beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame
. E                  B            C#m
 The image of love upon death’s frame

[P1]
. A                      C#m B
 If having my heart was worth the pain
. A                      C#m B         E/G#
 What joy could You see beyond the grave
. A                            C#m  B
 If love found my soul worth dying for

[C1]
.       E           B   C#m7
 How wonderful, how glorious
.   A      E             B   C#m7
 My Saviour’s scars, victorious
.   G#m7 Amaj7         B        C#m7
 My chains are gone, my debt is paid
.     A     E                    B    A
 From death to life and grace to grace

. | E B | C#m7 A | E B | C#m7 A |

[V2]
. E                     B      C#m A
 If heaven now owns that vacant tomb
. E                   B       C#m  A
 How great is the hope that lives in You
 ||
. E                     B            C#m A
 The passion that tore through hell like a rose
. E                     B            C#m 
 The promise that rolled back death and its stone

[P2]
. A                      C#m B
 If freedom is worth the life You raised
. A                      C#m B         E/G#
 Oh where is my sin, where is my shame
. A                            C#m  B
 If love paid it all to have my heart

[C2]
.     A   E          B   C#m7
 How wonderful, how glorious
.    A        E         B    C#m7
 My Saviour’s scars, victorious
.      G#m7  Amaj7        B       C#m7
 My chains are gone, my debt is paid
.      A     E           C#m7  B      A
 From death to life and grace to grace

. | A B | C#m7 A | E | B |

[B]
. A                              B
 When I see that cross, I see freedom
. C#m7                             A
 When I see that grave, I’ll see Jesus
. E
 And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
. B
 In the wonder of Your grace

[T]
. A                B          C#m7
 How my soul will sing Your praise
.                         A E
 In the wonder of Your grace
.                                 B
 How my soul will sing Your praise</lyrics>
