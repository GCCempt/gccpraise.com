  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em             D           G    Am7               Dsus          D
 Should He who made the stars be hung up on a tree?
.Em             D               G    Am7                   Dsus          D
 And should the hands that healed be driven through for me?||
.       C                 D       C                  Em7
 Should he who gave us bread be made to swallow gall?
.       C                D           G       F                   Dsus D
 Should he who gave us breath and life be slaughtered for us all?
 
 
[C]
. G            D 
 We sing your mercies
.Em           C
 We sing your endless praises
.G            D     Em        C
 We sing your everlasting love||
.G            D       Em            C
 We sing your mercies, We sing your endless praises
.G          D       Em/C G         D        Em/C         G
 Sovereign one who died, Sovereign one who died for us
 
[V2]
.Em            D         G     Am7                Dsus D
 Should he who is the light be cast into the dark?
.Em              D         G     Am7                          Dsus       D
 And should the Lord of love be pierced through his own heart?||
.       C                  D          C              Em7
 Should he who called us friends be deserted by us all?
.       C                  D     G       F                   Dsus        D
 Should he who lived a sinless life be punished for our fall?
