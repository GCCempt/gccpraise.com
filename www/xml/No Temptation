  <lyrics>[V1]
 There is no temptation taken you but such is common to man
 For God is faithful my friend don’t you know the sovereign God is faithful
 
 Never will He allow you to be tempted above what you are able to deal with
 But every time you’re tempted to sin my friend God will always give a way to escape
[V2] 
 So that you can bear the trial when it comes and stand up underneath temptation
 That’s why you flee from idolatry because God is faithful to you
 
 You can’t drink from the cup of the Lord and hold on to the demon’s chalice too
 You either have to drink from the cup of life or stick with the cup of death
[V3] 
 You can’t have a part at the Lord’s table if your seat is reserved at the demon’s feast
 Even Jesus taught you the same my friend you can only serve one master
 
 Our forefathers were all under the cloud they all passed through the sea
 Baptized into Moses in the cloud and the sea don’t forget your history
[V4] 
 They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink
 They drank from the spiritual rock with them the rock was Christ the King of kings
 
 But most of them displeased the Lord our God so He scattered them over the desert
 Now these things were written as examples to us to keep our hearts pure and just
[V5] 
 Twenty-three thousand Israelites fell because they turned away from the Lord
 So if you think you standing firm my friend be careful that you do not fall
 
 Some them put the Lord to the test and the Lord killed many with snakes
 So if you think you got it made in the shade be careful that you’re not a fake
[V6] 
 There is no temptation taken you but such is common to man
 For God is faithful my friend don’t you know the sovereign God is faithful
 
 Never will He allow you to be tempted above what you are able to deal with
 But every time you’re tempted to sin my friend God will always give a way to escape
[V7] 
 So that you can bear the trial when it comes and stand up underneath temptation
 That’s why you flee from idolatry because God is faithful to you
 
 Jesus is the way the truth and the life who helps us in all of our strife
 He’s been tempted every way as we have been but never did He fall and sin
[V8]
 Jesus God’s Son is our Great High Priest who has passed up through the skies
 So hold fast to your faith in Him don’t you fall for Satan’s wicked lies
 
 Let’s boldly run to God’s throne of grace to receive His mercy and seek His face
 His grace suffices for all we need and Jesus always lives to intercede
[V9] 
 There is no temptation taken you but such is common to man
 For God is faithful my friend don’t you know the sovereign God is faithful
 
 Never will He allow you to be tempted above what you are able to deal with
 But every time you’re tempted to sin my friend God will always give a way to escape
[V10] 
 So that you can bear the trial when it comes and stand up underneath temptation
 That’s why you flee from idolatry because God is faithful to you
