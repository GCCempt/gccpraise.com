  <title>Sweet Hour of Prayer</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
 That calls me from a world of care, ||
 And bids me at my Father's throne,
 Make all my wants and wishes known!||
 In seasons of distress and grief,
 My soul has often found relief, ||
 And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
 By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

[V2]
 Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
 The joys I feel, the bliss I share ||
 Of those whose anxious spirits burn
 With strong desires for thy return!||
 With such I hasten to the place
 Where God, my Saviour, shows his face, ||
 And gladly take my station there,
 And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

[V3]
 Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
 Thy wings shall my petition bear ||
 To him, whose truth and faithfulness
 Engage the waiting the soul to bless:||
 And since he bids me seek his face,
 Believe his Word, and trust his grace, ||
 I'll cast on him my ev'ry care,
 And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

[V4]
 Sweet hour of prayer, Sweet hour of prayer
 May I Thy consolation share ||
 Till from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height
 I view my home and take my flight ||
 This robe of flesh I’ll drop and rise
 To seize the everlasting prize ||
 And shout while passing through the air
 “Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer”

[E]
 This robe of flesh I’ll drop and rise
 To seize the everlasting prize ||
 And shout while passing through the air
 “Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer”
