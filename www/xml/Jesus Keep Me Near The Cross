[V1]
 Jesus, keep me near the cross; there a precious fountain, 
 free to all, a healing stream, flows from Calvary's mountain. 
 
[C]
 In the cross, in the cross, be my glory ever, 
 till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.
 
[V2]
 Near the cross, a trembling soul, love and mercy found me; ||
 there the Bright and Morning Star sheds its beams around me. 
 
[V3]
 Near the cross! O Lamb of God, bring its scenes before me; 
 help me walk from day to day with its shadow o'er me. 
 
[V4]
 Near the cross I'll watch and wait, 
 hoping, trusting ever, ||
 till I reach the golden strand 
 just beyond the river.
