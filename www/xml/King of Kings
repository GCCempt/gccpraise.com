  <lyrics>[V1]
.        D/F#            G
 In the darkness we were waiting
.          A              D
 Without hope without light ||
.           D/F#                 G
 Till from heaven You came running
.           A                D
 There was mercy in Your eyes ||
.     D/F#                 G
 To fulfill the law and prophets
.      A                      D
 To a virgin came the Word ||
.        D/F#                   G
 From a throne of endless glory
.      A             D
 To a cradle in the dirt

[C1]
.D                   G
 Praise the Father Praise the Son
. Bm                   D/A     A
 Praise the Spirit three in one ||
.D               G
 God of glory, Majesty
.Bm7            G2      A        D
 Praise forever to the King of Kings


[V2]
.  D/F#                      G
 To reveal the kingdom coming
.        A              D
 And to reconcile the lost ||
.    D/F#               G
 To redeem the whole creation
.        A                 D
 You did not despise the cross ||
.    D/F#          G
 For even in Your suffering
.        A              D
 You saw to the other side ||
.        D/F#                G
 Knowing this was our salvation
.      A                     D
 Jesus for our sake You died



[V3]
.        Bm                  G
 And the morning that You rose
.        A                  D
 All of heaven held its breath ||
.           Bm                       G
 Till that stone was moved for good
.         A                    D
 For the Lamb had conquered death ||
.         Bm                      G
 And the dead rose from their tombs
.        A                D
 And the angels stood in awe ||
.        Bm                   G
 For the souls of all whoâ€™d come
.        A             D
 To the Father are restored

[V4]
.         D/F#                      G
 And the Church of Christ was born
.           A                 D
 Then the Spirit lit the flame ||
.         D/F#                  G
 Now this gospel truth of old
.           A                    D
 Shall not kneel, shall not fade ||

.        D/F#                 G
 By His blood and in His name
.             A                  D
 And in His freedom I am free ||
.        D/F#                G
 For the love of Jesus Christ
.        A            D
 Who has resurrected me

[C2]
.D                   G
 Praise the Father Praise the Son
. Bm                   D/A     A
 Praise the Spirit three in one ||
.D               G
 God of glory, Majesty
.Bm7            G2      A        D
 Praise forever to the King of Kings ||
.Bm7            G2      A        D
 Praise forever to the King of Kings
