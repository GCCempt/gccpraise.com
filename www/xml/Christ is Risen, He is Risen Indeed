  <title>Christ is Risen, He is Risen Indeed</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]

 How can it be the One who died

 Has borne our sin through sacrifice ||

 To conquer every sting of death

 Sing, sing hallelujah


[V2]
 
 For joy awakes as dawning light

 When Christ's disciples lift their eyes ||

 Alive He stands their Friend and King

 Christ, Christ, He is risen


[C]

 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed

 Oh sing hallelujah ||

 Join the chorus sing with the redeemed

 Christ is risen, He is risen indeed 


[V3]

 Where doubt and darkness once had been

 They saw Him and their hearts believed ||

 But blessed are those who have not seen

 Yet sing hallelujah


[V4]

 Once bound by fear now bold in faith

 They preached the truth and power of grace ||

 And pouring out their lives they gained

 Life, life everlasting


[V5]
 
 The power that raised Him from the grave

 Now works in us to powerfully save ||

 He frees our hearts to live His grace

 Go tell of His goodness


[E]

 He's alive He's alive

 Heaven's gates are opened wide ||

 He's alive He's alive

 Now in heaven glorified
