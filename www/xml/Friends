[V1]   
.G               Bm            Em   
 Packing up the dreams God planted,   
.Am                        D/F#   C/D  
 In the fertile soil of you,   
.G                  Bm           Em9   
 Can't believe the hopes He's granted,   
.Am7                                  D/F#   
 Means a chapter in your life is through,   
   
   
[B]   
.D/F                            E   
 But well keep you close as always,   
.         Am9              Cm   
 It won't even seem you've gone,   
.G                    Bm        Em   
 cause our hearts in big and small ways,   
.     Am7                   D/F#          C/G  G C/D  
 will keep the love that keeps us strong,   
   
[C1]
.            G                   D/F#          C                 D   
 And friends are friends forever if the Lords the Lord of them,   
.       G                  D/F#            C                D   
 And a friend will not say never cause the welcome will not end,  || 
.           Bsus            B          Em               C   
 Though its hard to let you go, in the Fathers hands we know,   
.       Am7               D7sus            G  
 That a lifetime's not too long, to live as friends,       
   
   
[V2]   
 And with the faith and love God's given,    
 Springing from the hope we know,    
 We will pray the joy you live in,    
 Is the strength that now you show,
