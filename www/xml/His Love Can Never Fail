  <lyrics>[V1]
 I do not ask to see the way 
 My feet will have to tread; 
 But only that my soul may feed 
 Upon the living Bread. ||
 'Tis better far that I should walk 
 By faith close to His side; 
 I may not know the way I go, but oh, I know my Guide. 
 
[C] 
 His love can never fail, His love can never fail, 
 My soul is satisfied to know His love can never fail. 
 My soul is satisfied to know His love can never fail. 
 
[V2]
 And if my feet would go astray, 
 They cannot, for I know 
 That Jesus guides my falt'ring steps, 
 As joyfully I go. ||
 And though I may not see His face, 
 My faith is strong and clear, 
 That in each hour of sore distress 
 My Savior will be near. 
 
[V3]
 I will not fear, though darkness come 
 Abroad o'er all the land, 
 If I may only feel the touch 
 Of His own loving hand. ||
 And though I tremble when I think 
 How weak I am, and frail, 
 My soul is satisfied to know 
 His love can never fail.
