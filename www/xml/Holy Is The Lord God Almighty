[B]
.       E         B
 It is rising up all around
.           D             A
 It’s the anthem of the Lord's renown
 
 
;Behind the Song:
;"This song was inspired by the picture of worship around the throne of God in
;Isaiah 6. The heavenly creatures sounding this anthem back and forth to one another…
;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
;The whole earth is full of his glory
;Louie Giglio helped complete the thought with another picture from Nehemiah, where the people
;joined in a mass assembly…A great example of corporate worship. The Bible says they raised their
;hands to God at the hearing of his Word, they bowed with their faces to the ground and together
;made this statement… “the joy of the Lord is our strength.”" - Chris Tomlin</lyrics>
