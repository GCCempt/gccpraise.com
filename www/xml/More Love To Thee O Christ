  <lyrics>[V1]
 More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee! 
 Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee. ||
 This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to thee; 
 more love to thee, more love to thee! 
 
[V2]
 Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest; 
 now thee alone I seek, give what is best. ||
 This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee; 
 more love to thee, more love to thee! 
 
[V3] 
 Let sorrow do its work, send grief and pain; 
 sweet are thy messengers, sweet their refrain, ||
 when they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to thee; 
 more love to thee, more love to thee! 
 
[V4] 
 Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise; 
 this be the parting cry my heart shall raise; ||
 this still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee; 
 more love to thee, more love to thee!
