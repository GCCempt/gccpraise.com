[V1]
.G      D/F#    Em               Bm       Em
 Lord I come to You, let my heart be changed renewed
.               C              D       Em   D
 Flowing from the grace that I've found in You.||
.G         D/F#     Em             Bm     Em
 Lord I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me
.                 C D                   C   G G/F# G/A G/B
 Will be stripped away by the power of Your love.
 
[C]
.C        D                    C    G  G/F# G/A G/B
  Hold me close, let Your love surround me.
.C       D                   G G/A G/B
 Bring me near, draw me to Your side.||
.C     D                        C G
 And as I wait, I'll rise up like the eagle,
.Dsus/F#            Em                       C
 And I will soar with You, Your Spirit leads me on
.D           C   G
 In the power of Your love.
 
[V2]
 Lord unveil my eyes let me see You face to face:
 The knowledge of Your love as You live in me.||
 Lord renew my mind as Your will unfolds my life
 In living everyday by the power of Your love.
