.G/B                 C        G/B            C
 From wherever spring arrives, to heal the ground
.G/B                      C        G/B         C
 From wherever searching comes, || the look itself
.G/B                         C            G/B             C
 A trace of what we’re looking for, so be quiet now, and wait
 
[V2]
 
.G/B        C              G/B                  C
 And what was said unto the rose, to make it unfold
.G/B             C          G/B                C        G/B      C
 Was said to me here in my chest, so be quiet now, and rest
 
[P1]
.D  C        D   C          D       C
 The ocean, is growing, the tide is coming in, here it is
 
[C]
.             G                G/B
 Here is our King, here is our love
.              C                                   G
 Here is our God who’s come, to bring us back to Him
.          G/B          C
 He is the One, He is Jesus
