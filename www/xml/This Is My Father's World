  <lyrics>[V1]
.      Eb    Bb       Eb         Fm    Eb        Bb
 This is my Father’s world, and to my list'ning ears
.Bb7  Eb     G          G/B      Cm        Eb    Bb      Eb
 All nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres.||
.      Eb    Ab       Eb       Ab      F       Bb
 This is my Father’s world: I rest me in the thought ||
.Bb7  Eb       G        G/B        Cm
 Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
.     Eb        Bb       Eb
 His hand the wonders wrought.
 
 
[V2]
.      Eb    Bb       Eb         Fm           Eb     Bb
 This is my Father’s world, the birds their carols raise,
.Bb7  Eb       G         G/B   Cm      Eb          Bb       Eb 
 The morning light, the lily white, declare their Maker’s praise.||
.      Eb     Ab        Eb       Ab        F          Bb 
 This is my Father’s world: He shines in all that’s fair; ||
.Bb7     Eb       G       G/B       Cm 
 In the rustling grass I hear Him pass; 
.     Eb           Bb    Eb
 He speaks to me everywhere.
 
 
[V3]
.      Eb    Bb       Eb        Fm    Eb       Bb 
 This is my Father’s world. O let me ne’er forget ||
.Bb7   Eb         G          G/B      Cm         Eb     Bb    Eb  
 That though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet.||
.      Eb    Ab       Eb         Ab      F      Bb  
 This is my Father’s world: the battle is not done: ||
.Bb7 Eb      G            G/B   Cm  
 Je-sus Who died shall be satisfied,
.     Eb        Bb       Eb    
 And earth and Heav’n be one.
 
 
[T]
.      Eb    Ab       Eb         Ab      F      Bb  
 This is my Father’s world: the battle is not done:
.Bb7 Eb      G            G/B   Cm  
 Jesus Who died shall be satisfied, ||
.     Eb        Bb       Eb 
 And earth and Heav’n be one.</lyrics>
