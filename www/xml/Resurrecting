  <lyrics>;Intro
.F     F     Am     G

[V1]
.              F        Am            G
 The head that once was crowned with thorns
.                F     C
 Is crowned with glory now
.           F        Am       G
 The Savior knelt to wash our feet
.           F       C
 Now at His feet we bow


[V2]
.            F        Am       G
 The One who wore our sin and shame
.             F     C
 Now robed in majesty
.        F       Am       G
 The radiance of perfect love
.               F      C
 Now shines for all to see


[C1]
.     F          C       G
 Your name, Your name is victory
.     F          C       G
 All praise will rise to Christ our King
.    F          C       G
 Your name, Your name is victory
.    F           C       G
 All praise will rise to Christ our King


[V3]
.              F       Am        G
 The fear that held us now gives way
.           F      C
 To Him who is our peace
.          F       Am      G
 His final breath upon the cross
.        F       C
 Is now alive in me


[B]
.F       C             G             Am           F
 By Your Spirit I will rise from the ashes of defeat
.      C         G                      F
 The resurrected King is resurrecting me||
.        C           G        Am                F
 In Your name I come alive to declare Your victory
.      C         G           
 The resurrected King is resurrecting me


[V4]
.F C G
.               F        Am         G
 The tomb where soldiers watched in vain
.             F         C
 Was borrowed for three days
.          F          Am     G
 His body there would not remain
.            F           C
 Our God has robbed the grave
.            F           C
 Our God has robbed the grave


[E]
. F     C         G           
 The resurrected King is resurrecting me
. F C G
.F C G
