  <lyrics>;Intro  
.Gm F Bb Eb 

[V1]
.Bb 
 You unravel me, with a melody
.Eb              F         Bb
 You surround me with a song
.Bb 
 Of deliverance, from my enemies    
.     Eb      F         Bb
 Till all my fears are gone

[C]            
.       Eb       F          Bb
 I’m no longer a slave to fear
.  Gm   F        Bb
 I am a child of God

[V2]           
.                 Bb                          
 From my Mothers womb   
.                  Dm                              
 You have chosen me
.Eb       F         Bb
 Love has called my name                            
.                 Bb                   Dm
 I’ve been born again, into your family
.     Eb          F               Bb
 Your blood flows through my veins 

[I] 
.Gm F Bb Eb 

 I am surrounded
 By the arms of the father
 I am surrounded
 By songs of deliverance||

 We've been liberated
 From our bondage
 We're the sons and the daughters
 Let us sing our freedom

 Ohhh, Ohhh...

[B]
.Gm             F             Bb         Eb
 You split the sea so I could walk right through it
.Gm           F                  Bb  
 My fears are drowned in perfect love
.Gm          F             Bb           Eb
 You rescued me and I will stand and sing
.  Gm         F  Bb  
 I am a child of God (X4)</lyrics>
