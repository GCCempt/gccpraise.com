  <lyrics>[V1]
. C         F
 I lift my eyes up,
. C      F
 To the mountains
. C             F    C    G
 Where does my help come from? ||
. C             F
 My help comes from You,
. C           F
 Maker of Heaven,
. C       F  C   G
 Creator of the earth.
 
[C]
. C       F        C
 O how I need you Lord,
.           F    C
 You are my only hope,
.           F C  G
 You are my only prayer. ||
. C         F        C
 So I will wait for you,
.               F   C
 To come and rescue me,
.         F    C  G
 Come and give me life.

 To come and rescue me,
.         F    C  G
 Come and give me life.</lyrics></song>
