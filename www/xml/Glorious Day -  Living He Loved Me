  <lyrics>[V1]
.B       E                      B
 One day when Heaven was filled with His praises
.        E                      B
 One day when sin was as black as could be ||
.      E                    B
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
.           E                  C#m7
 Dwelt among men, my example is He||
.         E                       G#m
 Word became flesh and the light shined among us
.           E
 His glory revealed
 
[C]
.           B
 Living, He loved me
.         F#
 Dying, He saved me
.         G#m               E
 Buried, He carried my sins far away ||
.        B                 F#
 Rising, He justified freely forever
.           G#m
 One day He’s coming
.           E              B   E
 Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
 
[V2]
.B       E                      B
 One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain
.        E                      B
 One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
.      E                    B
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
.           E                  C#m7
 Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He ||
.         E                       G#m
 Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree
.           E
 And took the nails for me
 
[V3]
.B       E                      B
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
.        E                      B
 One day the stone rolled away from the door ||
.      E                    B
 Then He arose, over death He had conquered
.           E                  C#m7
 Now He’s ascended, my Lord evermore ||
.         E                       G#m
 Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him
.           E
 From rising again
 
[B]
.E          B       F#
 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
.E         B           F#      G#m
 One day the skies with His glories will shine||
.E        B       F#      G#m
 Wonderful day, my Beloved One, bringing
.E
 My Savior, Jesus, is mine</lyrics>
