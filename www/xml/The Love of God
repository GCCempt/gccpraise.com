  <title>The Love of God</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                         Bm
 The love of God is greater far
.               A             D
 Than tongue or pen can ever tell; ||
.                           Bm
 It goes beyond the highest star,
.            A               D
 And reaches to the lowest hell;||
.           G                      D
 The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
.             A        D
 God gave His Son to win;||
.           G              D
 His erring child He reconciled,
.             A          D
 And pardoned from his sin.
. G  Bm  A 
 
 
[V2]
 
.           D                Bm
 When years of time shall pass away,
.            Asus                 D
 And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,||
.                            Bm
 When men who here refuse to pray,
.             A                  D
 On rocks and hills and mountains call,||
.              G                   D
 God’s love so sure, shall still endure,
.         A               D
 All measureless and strong;||
.          G               D
 Redeeming grace to Adam’s race—
.               A          D
 The saints’ and angels’ song.
 
 
[C]
.            G                    D
 Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
.   A                  D
 How measureless and strong! ||
.                       G            
 It shall forevermore endure—
.                A        D
 The saints’ and angels’ song.
 
 
[V3]
.              D             Bm
 Could we with ink the ocean fill,
.             Asus4              D
 And were the skies of parchment made, ||
.            D                Bm
 Were every stalk on earth a quill,
.          A                D
 And every man a scribe by trade;||
.              G            D
 To write the love of God above
.                 A     D
 Would drain the ocean dry; ||
.               G                  D
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
.                      A      D
 Though stretched from sky to sky.</lyrics>
