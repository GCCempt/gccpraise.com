  <lyrics>[V1]

 Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side. 
.D    A   D   G    A        G         D 
 Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. 
.D     D A/C# Bm     D/F#      A Em 
 Leave to thy God to order and provide;  
.Em D/F# G D         G             F# 
 In ev—ery change, He faithful will remain.|| 
.D D A/C#    Bm 
 Be still, my soul: 
. D/F#                 A Em 
 thy best, thy heavenly Friend 
.Em      D/F# G D 
 Through thorn—y ways 
.G         A7      D 
 leads to a joyful end. 

[V2] 
.D  A     D  G         A       G      A D
 Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake 
.D    A   D   G    A        G         D 
 To guide the future, as He has the past. 
.D     D A/C# Bm     D/F#      A Em
 Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake; 
.Em D/F# G D         G             F#
 All now mysterious shall be bright at last. ||
.D D A/C#    Bm 
 Be still, my soul: 
. D/F#                 A Em
 the waves and winds still know 
.Em      D/F# G D 
 His voice Who ruled 
.G         A7      D 
 them while He dwelt below. 

[V3]
.D  A     D  G         A       G      A D
 Be still, my soul: when dearest friends depart, 
.D    A   D   G    A        G         D 
 And all is darkened in the vale of tears, 
.D     D A/C# Bm     D/F#      A Em 
 Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart, 
.Em D/F# G D         G             F#
 Who comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears. ||
.D D A/C#    Bm 
 Be still, my soul: 
. D/F#        A Em
 thy Jesus can repay 
.Em      D/F# G D 
 From His own fullness 
.G     A7      D 
 all He takes away. 

[V4] 
.D  A     D  G         A       G      A D 
 Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on

 When we shall be forever with the Lord. 
.D     D A/C# Bm     D/F#      A Em 
 When dis-a-ppointment, grief, and fear are gone, 
.Em D/F# G D         G             F#
 Sorrow for-got, love’s purest joys restored. ||
.D D A/C#    Bm 
 Be still, my soul: 
.     D/F#                A Em 
 when change and tears are past, 
. Em D/F# G   D        G        A7      D 
 All safe and bless-ed we shall meet at last.
