[V1]
.     Am       C         G       Em
 What Child is this who, laid to rest
.   Am      F      E	
 On Mary's lap is sleeping? ||
.     Am     C          G       Em	
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
.      Am        E7          Am  	
 While shepherds watch are keeping? || 
.C             G          Em
 This, this is Christ the King,
.     Am        F          E	
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. ||
.C                G         Em	
 Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
.    Am        E7	  Am
 The Babe, the Son of Mary.
 
[V2]
.     Am       C         G       Em
 Why lies He in such mean estate,
.   Am      F      E
 Where ox and sheep are feeding? ||
.     Am     C          G       Em
 Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
.      Am        E7          Am 
 The silent Word is pleading.|| 
.C             G          Em
 Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
.     Am        F          E
 The cross be borne for me, for you. ||
.C                G         Em
 Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
.    Am        E7	  Am
 The Babe, the Son of Mary.

[V3]
.     Am       C         G       Em
 So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
.   Am      F      E
 Come peasant, king to own Him; ||
.     Am     C          G       Em
 The King of kings salvation brings,
.      Am        E7          Am 
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him. ||
.C             G          Em
 Raise, raise a song on high,
.     Am        F          E
 The virgin sings her lullaby. ||
.C                G         Em
 Joy, joy for Christ is born,
.    Am        E7	  Am
 The Babe, the Son of Mary
 
[E]
.C             G          Em
 This, this is Christ the King,
.     Am        F          E
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. ||
.C                G         Em	
 Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
.    Am        E7	  Am	
 The Babe, the Son of Mary.
