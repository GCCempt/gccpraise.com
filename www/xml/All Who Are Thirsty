.              G
 All who are thirsty
.             Bm 
 all who are weak
.               C2
 come to the fountain 
.                         Am  G/B C2
 dip your heart in the stream of life ||
.        Dsus           G
 let the pain and the sorrow
.            Bm 
 be washed away,
.                    C2
 in the wave of his mercy
.               Am G/B C    Dsus 
 as deep cries out to deep, we sing
