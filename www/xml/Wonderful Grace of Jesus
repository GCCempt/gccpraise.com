  <lyrics>[V1]
. C                 Cdim6 C 
 Wonderful grace of Jesus,
. C           G       C  E7/B
 Greater than all my sin; ||
. Am7     
 How shall my tongue describe it,
. G              D7         G   G7
 Where shall its praise begin? ||
.C              Cdim6 C
 Taking away my burden,
.C                 F
 Setting my spirit free; ||
.        Cdim6               C Ab7 C   G   C
 For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.
 
[C]
.C                                G
 Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,
.C                                 G
 Deeper than the mighty rolling sea; ||
.G                         C
 Higher than the mountain, sparkling like a fountain, 
.D                              G           G7
 All sufficient grace for even me, for even me. ||
.C                            G
 Broader than the scope of my transgressions,
.C                               F
 Greater far than all my sin and shame, ||
.  F                     C       F
 O magnify the precious name of Jesus.
.C      G   C
 Praise His name!
 
[V2]
. C                 Cdim6 C
 Wonderful grace of Jesus,
. C           G       C   E7/B
 Reaching to all the lost, ||
. Am7     
 By it I have been pardoned,
. G              D7         G   G7
 Saved to the uttermost,||
.C                      Cdim6 C
 Chains have been torn asunder,
.C              F
 Giving me liberty; ||
.        Cdim6               C Ab7 C   G   C
 For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.
 
 
[V3]
. C                 Cdim6 C
 Wonderful grace of Jesus,
. C           G       C   E7/B
 Reaching the most defiled,||
. Am7     
 By its transforming power,
. G              D7         G   G7
 Making him Godâ€™s dear child,||
.C                    Cdim6 C
 Purchasing peace and heaven,
.C             F
 For all eternity; ||
.        Cdim6               C Ab7 C   G   C
 And the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.
