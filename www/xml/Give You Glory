  <lyrics>[V1]
.        D                                 Bm
 We have raised a thousand voices, just to lift Your holy name,
.            G                                      A
 and we will raise thousands more, to sing of Your beauty in this place, ||
.     D                             Bm
 oh.  None can even fathom, no, not one define Your worth, 
.      G                               A
 as we marvel in Your presence to the ends of the earth.

.            D                                       Bm
 We give You glory, lifting up our hands and singing Holy,
.              G                       Gm
 You alone are worthy, we just want to touch Your heart Lord, touch Your heart.

[V2]
.      D                              Bm
 As we fall down before You, with our willing hearts we seek,
.       G                                 A
 in the greatness of Your glory, it's so hard to even speak. ||
.         D                         Bm
 There is nothing we can offer, no, nothing can repay.
.      G                              A
 so we give You all our praises, and lift our voices to sing.

 You alone are worthy, we just want to touch Your heart Lord, touch Your heart. ||
