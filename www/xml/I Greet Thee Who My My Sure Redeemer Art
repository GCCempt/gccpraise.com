  <lyrics>[V1]
 I greet Thee, who my sure Redeemer art,
 My only trust and Savior of my heart,
 Who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;
 I pray Thee from our hearts all cares to take.
 
[V2]
 Thou art the King of mercy and of grace,
 Reigning omnipotent in every place;
 So come, O King, and our whole being sway;
 Shine on us with the light of Thy pure day.
 
[V3]
 Thou art the life, by which alone we live,
 And all our substance and our strength receive;
 Oh comfort us in death's approaching hour, 
 Strong-hearted then to face it by Thy power.
 
[V4]
 Thou hast the true and perfect gentleness,
 No harshness hast Thou and no bitterness;
 Make us to taste the sweet grace found in Thee 
 And ever stay in Thy sweet unity.
 
[V5]
 Our hope is in no other save in Thee;
 Our faith is built upon Thy promise free;
 Oh grant to us such stronger help and sure,
 That we can boldly conquer and endure.</lyrics></song>
