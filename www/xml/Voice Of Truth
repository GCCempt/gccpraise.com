.Bsus             B                G#m              G#m7
 Oh what i would do to have, the kind of faith it takes to climb out of this
.E            A                 E          Bsus        B                 G#m
 boat i'm in, onto the crashing waves, ||to step out of my comfort zone, into the
.G#m7                        E                  A               E
 realm of the unknown, where Jesus is ||and he's holding out his hand, but the
.F#         E                           Bsus     B     F#          E
 waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me, reminding me of all the

 times i've tried before and failed || the waves they keep on telling me, time
.     F#     G#m         Esus            F#2      B
 and time again "boy you never win, you never win"

   But the voice of truth tells me a different story, the voice of truth
.                     B                      F#                         G#m
 says "Do not be afraid", and the voice of truth, says "This is for my glory" ||
.                       Esus             G#m                Esus
 out of all the voices calling out to me, i will choose to listen and believe

 the voice of truth

.Bsus             B                G#m              G#m7
 oh what i would do to have, the kind of strength it takes to stand before a

 giant, with just a sling and a stone || surrounded by the sound, of a thousand
.G#m       G#m7             E                   A
 warriors shaking in their armor, wishing they'd have had the strength to

 stand || but the giants calling out my name and he laughs at me, reminding me

 of all times, i've tried before and failed || the giant keeps on telling me,
. E       F#     G#m           Esus            F#2      B
 time and time again "Boy, you never win, you never win"</lyrics></song>
