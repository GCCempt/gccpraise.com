  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bb              F          Eb          Bb            Gm        Bb       Eb F Bb
 A mighty        fortress   is our      God, a        Bulwark   never    fa_i_ling;
.Bb           F         Eb        Bb           Gm       Bb        Eb F    Bb
 Our Helper   He a______mid the   flood of     mortal   ills pre__va_i____ling;||
.    Gm        Csus C     F          Bb      Eb      Gm
 For still our an___cient Foe doth   seek to work us woe; || 
.     Gm        Csus  C   F           Gm         Cm      D
 His  craft and pow'r are great, and  armed with cruel   hate,
.    Gm       Bb         Eb F Bb
 On  earth is not his    e____qual.
 
[V2]
 Did we in       our own    strength confide, our     striving  would be lo___sing; ||
 Were not the right Man on our    side, the    Man of   God's own choo____sing;||
 Dost ask who  that may   be? Christ Jesus   it is   He; ||
 Lord Sa-ba-_____oth   His name, from  age to     age the same,
 And He must  win the    bat__tle.
 
[V3]
 And though this world, with devils      filled, should threaten  to un____do   us; ||
 We will not  fear for  God hath  willed His   truth to triumph   through us:||
 The prince of dark_ness  grim, we   tremble not for him; ||
 His  rage we   can   en__dure, for    lo! his    doom is sure,
 One little   word shall fell him.
 
[V4]
 That Word a_____bove all   earthly     pow'rs, no     thanks to them, a___bid__eth; ||
 The Spirit   and the   gifts are ours through Him who  with us   si______deth;||
 Let goods and kin__dred  go, this   mortal  life al_so; ||
 The  body      they  may kill; God's truth a____bideth  still,
 His kingdom  is for_____e____ver!</lyrics>
