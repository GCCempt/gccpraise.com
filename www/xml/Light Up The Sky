  <lyrics>;Intro: 
.Em  C  G  D (x2)
 
[V1]
.Em          C            G
 When I'm feeling all alone
.     D
 With so far to go
.Em               C               G
 The signs are nowhere on this road
. D
 Guiding me home ||
.Em          C               G
 When the night is closing in
.      D             Em
 It's falling on my skin
.    C                   G
 Oh God, will you come close?
 
[C1]
. Em                         C
 Light, light, light up the sky
.              G              D
 Light up the sky to show me you are with me
.Em               C
 I, I, I can't deny
.              G               D
 No I can't deny that you are right here with me
.       Em        C
 You've opened my eyes
.   G             D
 So I can see you all around me
. Em                         C
 Light, light, light up the sky
.                  G               D
 You light up the sky to show me
.              Em       C     (G     D) second time
 That you are with me
 
 Verse 2:
 When stars are hiding in the clouds
 I don't feel them shining
 When I can't see beyond my doubt
 The silver lining
 
 When I've almost reached the edge
 Like a flood you're rushing in
 Your love is rushing in
 
 (Chorus 1)
 
 Bridge:
     Am                      Em
 So I run, straight into your arms
             C                Am
 You're the brightened morning sun
 
 To show your love
         C            C (let ring)
 There's nothing you wont do
 
 
 Chorus 2:
 C                          G
 Light, light, light up the sky
                  D             Em
 You light up the sky to show me you are with me
 C                G
 I, I, I can't deny
              D              Em
 No I can't deny that you are right here with me
       C          G
 You've opened my eyes
   D             Em
 So I can see you all around me
 C                          G
 Light, light, light up the sky
                  D
 You light up the sky to show me
              C       G      D      Em
 That you are with me
              C       G      D      Em
 That you are with me
              C       G      D      Em
 That you are with me
