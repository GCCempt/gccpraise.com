.A/C#         E/D D   Esus F             A2         A/C#
 Above all powers,        above all kings,
.                E/D D             Esus E               A2 A/G#
 Above all nature and all         created things
.                F#m                 F#m/E                            D2   A/C#
 Above all wisdom and all           the ways of man
.Bm7                             Bm7/A                         E/G#  A/C#
 You were here before          the world began ||
.                E/D D             Esus E              A2  A/C#
 Above all kingdoms,                above all thrones
.                E/D D                       Esus           E              A2   A/G#
 Above all wonders the world           has ever known ||
.                F#m               F#m/E                       D2   A/C#
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
.Bm7                        Bm7/A                           C#sus      C3
 There's no way to measure what You're worth
 
[C]
.A            Bm7  E/G#                         A
 Crucified,          laid behind the stone
.                       Bm7  E/G#                    A
 You lived to die,      rejected and alone ||
.A/G#        F#m F#m/E                           D  A/C#
 Like a rose,      trampled on the ground
.                          Bm7  A/C#                            D2 Esus E  
 You took the fall                and thought of me
.A A/G# (D2/F#  A/C#) (A)
 Above all.
