  <title>Heidelberg Catechism Q&amp;Q 32-34</title>
  <lyrics> Q.32 (LEADER):  Why are you called a Christian?||

 A (CONGREGATION):  [I am called a Christian] Because I am a member of Christ by faith and thus share in His anointing, 
 so that I may as prophet confess His Name, ||
 as priest present myself a living sacrifice of thankfulness to Him, 
 and as king fight with a free and good conscience against sin and the devil in this life, 
 and hereafter reign with Him eternally over all creatures.||

 Q.34 (LEADER):  Why do you call Him our Lord? ||
 A (CONGREGATION):  [We call Him our Lord] Because He has ransomed us, body and soul, from all our sins, not with silver or gold but with His precious blood, and has freed us from all the power of the devil to make us His own possession.
