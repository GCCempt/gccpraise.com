.Am                                     G                       
 It’s just a matter of time a few days ago,
.                        
 I saw you, you were fine
.          F 
 Remembering what you said
 
 About the book you read
.      G
 The one I got you The Begining of the End
 
[V2]
.Am                   
 Oh how we talked, for hours upon end
.G
 What I would give just to do it again
.   F
 Your lying there in this hospital bed 
.              G
 Won’t you open your eyes 
 
 And let’s talk once again.
 
[C]
.Am                     G
 If you fly away tonight, 
. 			        F
 I wanna tell you that I love you.
.                          Dm
 I hope that you can hear me, 
.   E                      Am 
 I hope that you can feel me. ||
.                         G
 If you fly away tonight,
.                                  F
 I wanna tell you that Im sorry,
.                 Dm 
 That I never told you
.         E                   Am
 When we were face to face.
 
[V3]
.Am 
 Well I’ve been here all night 
.               G 
 And Im watching you
 
 Breathe in and breathe out
.    F
 Is it really you or just a machine
.        G
 That's giving you life and
.                           Am
 Making it seem that there could be hope ||
.     
 I could say it to your face
.    G
 If it weren't for you that 
. 
 There would be no grace 
.        F
 That's covered my life.
. 				      G
 You took the time to speak into my mind
.           
 And my heart Words of Life
 
[B]
.			             Dm
 So goodbye for now and I'll see you again some way, somehow
.C
 When it's my turn to go to the other side 
.     E
 I'll hold you again and melt at your smile ||
.F
 Now all I have are the ones that I'm with
.     Dm
 And you taught me not to take for granted ||
.      C
 The time that we have to show that we care
.         E				E	E	 E
 Speak into their minds and their hearts while they're here and say I love you
