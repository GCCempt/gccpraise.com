  <title>You're Beautiful</title>
  <lyrics>[C1]
.D                 G
 I see Your face in every sunrise
.       Bm                     A
 The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes||
.D                        G
 The world awakens in the light of the day
.   Bm                    A                       D
 I look up to the sky and say You're beautiful

[C2]
 I see Your power in the moonlit night
 Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright||
 We are amazed in the light of the stars
 It's all proclaiming who you are You're beautiful

[C3]
 I see you there hanging on a tree
 You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me||
 Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
 Soon we will be coming home You're beautiful

[C4]
 When we arrive at eternity's shore
 Where death is just a memory and tears are no more||
 We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
 Your bride will come together and sing You're beautiful
