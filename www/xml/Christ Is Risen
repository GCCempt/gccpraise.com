  <title>Christ Is Risen</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.E
 Let no one caught in sin remain
.  A                 
 Inside the lie of inward shame||
.E
 But fix our eyes upon the cross
.      A            C#m          B
 And run to Him who showed great love||
.      E  A   B
 And bled for us.               
.               E    A   B
 Freely You’ve bled for us

[C1]
.          E
 Christ is risen from the dead
.          E
 Trampling over death by death||
.      A
 Come awake, come awake
.         C#m              B
 Come and rise up from the grave||
.           E
 Christ is risen from the dead
.       E
 We are one with Him again||
.      A 
 Come awake, come awake
.          C#m             B
 Come and rise up from the grave

[V2]
.E
 Beneath the weight of all our sin
.A
 You bowed to none but heaven’s will||
.E/G#
 No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
.        A            C#m       B
 No burden great can hold You down||
.   E/G#         A      B
 In strength You reign
.         E/G#          A        B
 Forever let Your church proclaim

[C2]
.          E
 Christ is risen from the dead
.          E/G#
 Trampling over death by death||
.      A
 Come awake, come awake
.         C#m              B
 Come and rise up from the grave||
.           E
 Christ is risen from the dead
.       E/G#
 We are one with Him again||
.      A 
 Come awake, come awake
.          C#m             B
 Come and rise up from the grave


[B]
.E  A     C#m            B
 O death, where is your sting?
.E  A     C#m            B
 O hell, where is your victory?||
.E  A     C#m            B
 O church, come stand in the light
.E  A     C#m            B
 The glory of God has defeated the night||
.E  A     C#m            B
 O death, where is your sting?
.E  A     C#m            B
 O hell, where is your victory?||
.E  A     C#m            B
 O church, come stand in the light
.E  A     C#m            B
 Our God is not dead
.E  A     C#m            B
 He's alive! He's alive!</lyrics>
