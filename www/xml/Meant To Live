  <lyrics>[V1]
 Fumbling his confidence and wondering why the world has passed him by
 Hoping that he's built for more than arguments and failed attempts to fly.
 
 
[C]
 We were meant to live for so much more have we lost ourselves?
 Somewhere we live inside, somewhere we live inside.
 (Repeat)
 
 
[V2]
 Dreaming about Providence and whether mice or men have second tries
 Maybe we been living with our eyes half open, maybe we're bent &amp; broken.
 
[B]
 We want more than this world's got to offer (2x)
 We want more than the wars of our fathers
 And everything inside screams for second life.
