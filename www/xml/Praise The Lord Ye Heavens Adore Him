  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 Praise the Lord: ye heav'ns, adore Him;
 
 Praise Him, angels in the height. ||
 
 Sun and moon, rejoice before Him;
 
 Praise Him, all ye stars and light.||
 
 Praise the Lord, for He hath spoken;
 
 Worlds His mighty voice obeyed. ||
 
 Laws which never shall be broken
 
 For their guidance He hath made.
 
 
[V2]
 
 Praise the Lord, for He is glorious;
 
 Never shall His promise fail. ||
 
 God hath made His saints victorious;
 
 Sin and death shall not prevail. ||
 
 Praise the God of our salvation;
 
 Hosts on high, His pow'r proclaim.||
 
 Heav'n and earth and all creation,
 
 Laud and magnify His Name.
 
 
[V3]
 
 Worship, honor, glory, blessing,
 
 Lord, we offer unto Thee; ||
 
 Young and old, Thy praise expressing,
 
 In glad homage bend the knee. ||
 
 All the saints in heav'n adore Thee;
 
 We would bow before Thy throne. ||
 
 As Thine angels serve before Thee,
 
 So on earth Thy will be done.</lyrics>
