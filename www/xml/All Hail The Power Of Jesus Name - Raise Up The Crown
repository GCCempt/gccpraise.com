 Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all

 Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race, ye ransomed from the fall
 Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all
 Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all

 O that, with yonder sacred throng, we at His feet may fall
 We’ll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all
 We’ll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all</lyrics>
