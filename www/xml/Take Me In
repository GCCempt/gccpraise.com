 Isaiah 6:3
 "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!"
 
;Intro:
.F#m, D, E , D x2
[V]
.F#m
 Take me past the outer courts
.D
 Into the Holy Place
.E
 Past the brazen altar
.        D                E
 Lord I want to see your face ||
.F#m
 Pass me by the crowds of people
.          D
 And the Priests who sing your praise
.    E
 I hunger and thirst for your righteousness
.          D                 E
 But it's only found in one place
 
[C]
.        F#m               E
 Take me into the holy of holies
.        D          E           F#m
 Take me in by the blood of the lamb
.        F#m                E
 Take me into the holy of holies
.          D              E          F#m
 Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am</lyrics></song>
