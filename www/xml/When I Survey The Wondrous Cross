  <lyrics>[V1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross
 On which the Prince of glory died,
 My richest gain I count but loss,
 And pour contempt on all my pride. 
 
[V2]
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
 Save in the death of Christ my God!
 All the vain things that charm me most,
 I sacrifice them to His blood.
 
[V3]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet,
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
 Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet,
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
 
[V4]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 That were a present far too small;
 Love so amazing, so divine,
 Demands my soul, my life, my all.
