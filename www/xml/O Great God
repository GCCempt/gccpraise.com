[V1]

 O great God of highest heav'n

 Occupy my lowly heart ||

 Own it all and reign supreme
.        Dm7   Gsus G  C
 Conquer every re-bel pow'r ||

 Let no vice or sin remain
.G       Am        F    Gsus G
 That resists Your holy war ||
.         F2/A       G/B      C

[V2]
.        C      F/G   C
 I was blinded by my sin

 Had no ears to hear Your voice ||
.        C         F/G      C 
 Did not know Your love within
.        Dm7      Gsus G   C 
 Had no taste for heaven's joys ||
. G        Am     G/F     C 
 Then Your Spirit gave me life
.G       Am          F  Gsus G 
 Opened up Your word to me ||
.            F2/A       G/B  C 
 Through the gospel of Your Son

 Gave me endless hope and peace
