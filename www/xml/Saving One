  <lyrics>;Intro:
.D A G A D
[V1]
.D
 What mercy was revealed
.                 A
 What selflessness and peace
.        G
 My fate was surely sealed
.    A        D
 Until he rescued me ||
.D
 His pardon for my sin
.                   A
 His bounty for my need
.        G
 From slavery and chains
.    A      D
 I am redeemed

[C1]
.D                      G
 And heaven canâ€™t contain
.       Bm          A
 The glory of the Son
.          G      Bm         A
 Jesus is the Christ the saving one||
.            G
 His love has made a way
.           Bm   A
 The grave is overcome
.           G     A       D
 Jesus is the Christ the saving one

[V2]
.D
 No fear can hold me down
.                       A
 Nor darkness steal my joy
.        G
 For blood has been poured out
.    A        D
 The enemy destroyed ||
.D
 Death could not hold him down
.                      A
 The cross was not enough
.        G
 To steal away his throne
.       A   D
 For he is God

[C2]
.D               G
 And heaven can't contain
.      Bm          A
 The glory of the son
.          G    Bm       A
 Jesus is the Christ the saving one||
.            G
 His love has made a way
.           Bm   A
 The grave is overcome
.           G    A       D
 Jesus is the Christ the saving one

[B]
.        G                     A
 And anyone who calls upon his name
.            G             A
 They will be saved, they will be saved
.        G                       A
 And anyone who calls upon his name
.            G          A           D
 They will be saved, they will be saved</lyrics>
