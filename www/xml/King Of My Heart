  <lyrics>[V1]
.        A                        D                A
 Let the King of my heart, be the mountain where I run
.    F#m              E          D     A
 The fountain I drink from, oh He is my song||
.        A                        D              A
 Let the King of my heart, be the shadow where I hide
.    F#m          E           D     A
 The ransom for my life, oh He is my Song

[C]
.        F#m  E     D  A
 You are good, good, o - h

 You are good, good, o - h

[V2]
.        A                        D              A
 Let the King of my heart, be the wind inside my sails 
.    F#m           E           D     A
 The anchor in the waves, oh He is my song||
.        A                        D              A
 Let the King of my heart, be the fire inside my veins
.    F#m       E           D     A
 The echo of my days, oh He is my song

  You're never gonna let, never gonna let me down
