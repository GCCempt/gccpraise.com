;Intro: 
.C   Am   F - G
 
[V1]
.C
 My hope is built on nothing less
.F                     G
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness ||
.Am                   Am/G
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
.F          G          C
 But wholly trust in Jesus' name
 
[C]
.       F      Am    G
 Christ alone, Cornerstone
.C/E       F             Am       G
 Weak made strong in the Savior's love ||
.C/E         F      .Am   G 
 Through the storm  He is Lord
.        C
 Lord of all
 
[V2]
.C 
 When darkness seems to hide His face
.F               G
 I rest on His unchanging grace ||
.Am                Am/G
 In every high and stormy gale
.F         G            C
 My anchor holds within the veil ||
.F         G            C 
 My anchor holds within the veil
--- 
[B]
.      Am
 He is Lord
.        F     G
 Lord of all
 
[V3]
.C
 When He shall come with trumpet sound
.F                G
 Oh may I then in Him be found ||
.Am                      Am/G
 Dressed in His righteousness alone
.F          G            C
 Faultless, stand before the throne
