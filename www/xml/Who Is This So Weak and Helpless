[V1]
.       Am               Em
 Who is this, so weak and helpless,
.        F    G      Am
 Child of lowly Hebrew maid,
.      Am         Em
 Rudely in a stable sheltered,
.     F     G      Am
 Coldly in a manger laid?||
.         C             G
 ’Tis the Lord of all creation,
.         Am   G              G
 Who this won--drous path has trod;
.      C             G
 He is Lord from everlasting,
.       F   G        C
 And to everlasting God.
 
[V2]
 Who is this, a Man of Sorrows,
 Walking sadly life’s hard way,
 Homeless, weary, sighing, weeping
 Over sin and Satan’s sway?||
 ’Tis our God, our glorious Savior,
 Who above the starry sky
 Is for us a place preparing,
 Where no tear can dim the eye.
 
[V3]
 Who is this? Behold him shedding
 Drops of blood upon the ground!
 Who is this, despised, rejected,
 Mocked, insulted, beaten, bound?||
 ’Tis our God, Who gifts and graces
 On His church is pouring down;
 Who shall smite in holy vengeance
 All His foes beneath His throne.
 
[V4]
 Who is this that hangs there dying
 While the rude world scoffs and scorns,
 Numbered with the malefactors,
 Torn with nails, and crowned with thorns?||
 ’Tis our God Who lives forever
 ’Mid the shining ones on high,
 In the glorious golden city,
 Reigning everlastingly.
 
[E]
.         C             G
 ’Tis our God Who lives forever
.         Am   G              G
 ’Mid the shining ones on high,
.      C             G
 In the glorious golden city,
.       F   G        C
 Reigning everlastingly.
