 I see you there hanging on a tree

 You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me ||

 Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne

 Soon we will be coming home You're beautiful

.C                 F
 When we arrive at eternity's shore
.       Am                     G
 Where death is just a memory and tears are no more ||
.C                        F
 We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
.   Am                    G                       C
 Your bride will come together and we'll sing You're beautiful</lyrics>
