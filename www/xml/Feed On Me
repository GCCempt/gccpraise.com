  <title>Feed On Me</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                G
 Bounty original, fullness above.
.Am               F
 Yielded creation abundant in love.||
.  C                    G
 A garden, a calling to nurture and name –
.Am                        F
 Love’s naked fruitfulness hidden from shame.||
.    G            C            F
 But there in the fullness, an emptiness still,
.    G    C          F
 that He alone would fill.

[C1]
. C                        G
 “All this I give you: the wind and the light,
.    Am                     F
 and soil rendered into the body’s delight. ||
.    C                     G
 The gift of My Image, the fruit of the tree,
. Em  Am F   Em   Am G   F       C
 Feed on Me. Feed on Me. Feed on Me.”

[V2]
 Deep in our hunger, we nourished a fear:
 “What we were made for is not given here.||
 We ate the forbidden, and emptiness grew,
 Swallowing all of the life that we knew.||
 But there in the exile, of toil and of pain,
 His fullness still remained.

[C2]
 “All this I give you: the ram and the fire,
 And manna to answer the desert’s desire,||
 The fields for the gleaning, the richest fare free,
 Feed on Me. Feed on Me. Feed on Me.”
---
[V3]
 Emptiness threatened to swallow the earth
 ‘til heaven’s banquet came down in His birth.||
 Now, false food forsaking, He feeds us again,
 Nets full and breaking, and bread gathered in,||
 But love’s greatest table, no angel could tell:
 He feeds us with Himself.

[C3]
 “All this I give you: the True Bread come down,
 A table of joy for the lost ones, now found,||
 The blood and the body, the deep mystery,
 Feed on Me. Feed on Me. Feed on Me”

[V4]
.D                A
 Truly, we share now in Love’s banquet song!
.Bm               G
 Yet still we hunger and cry out “How long?”||
.  D                    A
 A pilgrimage people now making our way
.Bm                        G
 Nourishing hope at this table of faith.||
.    A            D            G
 But coming a banquet, desire meets delight,
.    A    D          G
 And faith gives way to sight.

[C4]
. D                        A
 “All this I give you: My fullness again,
.    Bm                     G
 The garden restored from the curses of sin,||
.    D                     A
 The feast of a wedding, the flowering tree,
 
 Feed on Me.

[C5]

 “All this I give you: My fullness again,
.    Bm                     G
 The garden restored from the curses of sin,||
.    D                     A
 The feast of a wedding, the flowering tree,
. F#m Bm G   F#m  Bm A   G       D
 Feed on Me. Feed on Me. Feed on Me.
