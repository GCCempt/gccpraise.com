.D                           A                  D
 Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere;
.D                                A7             D
 Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born.
 
[V1]
.      D                                  A                D
 While shepherds kept their watching o'er silent flocks by night,
.                                    A            A7
 Behold throughout the heavens there shone a Holy Light.
 
[V2]
.    D                                   A            D
 The shepherds feared and trembled when lo! Above the earth,
.                               A                    A7
 Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Saviour's birth.
 
[V3]
.     D                     A                 D
 Down in a lowly manger the humble Christ was born
.                                    A                 A
 And brought us God's salvation that blessed Christmas morn!
