[V1]
.         Em           D/F# G           G/B     C
 There's a place where mercy reigns and never dies 
.         Em           D/F#      G           G/B        C
 There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide

[P]
.             D                   C
 Where all the love, I've ever  found
.            D                     C
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down
 

[C]
.       C                    G
 At the Cross at the cross I surrender my life
.       D                  Am7
 I'm in awe of you, I'm in awe of You||
. Am7/B     C                   G
 Where Your Love ran red and my sin washed white
.      D                 Am7           C         G
 I owe all to You, I owe all to you (Jesus)

[V2]
.          Em          D/F#   G          G/B  C
 There's a place where sin and shame are powerless
.         Em        D/F#      G        G/B   C      
 Where my heart has peace with God and forgiveness

[C2]
.       C                    G
 At the Cross at the cross I surrender my life
.       D                  Am7
 I'm in awe of you, I'm in awe of You||
. Am7/B     C                   G
 Where Your Love ran red and my sin washed white
.      D                 Am7          
 I owe all to You, I owe all to you


[B]
.C                      Em
 Here my hope is found, here on holy ground
.G                D/F#
 Here I bow down, here I bow down||
.C                    Em
 Here arms open wide, here You saved my life
.G/D               D
 Here I bow down, here I bow

[T]
.      D                 Am7           C          G
 I owe all to You, I owe all to you (Jesus)
