  <lyrics>[V1]
 Been broken, put through a fire.
 Felt the heat melt all my strength away.
 Felt so lonely, felt so abandoned.
 "Where is God?" I heard my little voice say.
 
[C]
 I need You. I need You.
 Oh Lord, please hold me next to You.
 I need you. I need You.
 Oh Lord, don't let me fall from You.
 
[V2]
 Lord, I know this life isn't easy,
 And I know that You never promised no pain.
 Trials will come and trials will test me.
 But help me, Lord--it's hard to see them as gain
 I forgot that You're right beside me.
 Let me know that You're with me through the length.
 Though I'm weak, this is my prayer--
 Through my weakness, Lord, please be my strength.</lyrics></song>
