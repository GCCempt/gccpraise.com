  <title>God Rest You Merry Gentlemen</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay,
 Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day;
 To save us all from Satan’s power when we were gone astray.

[C]
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
 O tidings of comfort and joy.

[V2]
 From God our heavenly Father, a blessèd angel came;
 And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;
 How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name.

[V3]
 “Fear not, then,” said the angel, “Let nothing you afright
 This day is born a Savior of a pure virgin bright,
 To free all those who trust in Him, from Satan’s power and might.”

[V4]
 The shepherds at those tidings, re-joic-ed much in mind,
 And left their flocks a-feeding, in tempest, storm and wind,
 And went to Bethlehem straightway, the Son of God to find.

[V5]
 Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place,
 And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
 This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface.

[V6]
 God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign,
 And many a merry Christmas may live to see again;
 Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near—

[C2]
 That God send you a happy new year, happy new year,
 And God send you a happy new year.</lyrics>
