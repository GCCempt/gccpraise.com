  <lyrics>[V1]
.G              Em7         C2                       Dsus G
 What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
.G                Em7          C2                       Dsus G
 What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
 
[C]
.G           Em7
 Oh precious is the flow,
.Dsus
 That makes me white as snow;
.G        Em7
 No other fount I know,
.C2                       Dsus G
 Nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
 
[V2]
.G             Em7         C2                       Dsus G
 For my cleansing this I see, nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
.G                Em7           C2                      Dsus G
 For my pardon this my plea, nothing but the blood of Je__sus.
 
[V3]
 Nothing can for sin atone, nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
 Naught of good that I have done, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
 
 
[V4]
.G              Em7             C2                       Dsus G
 This is all my hope and peace, nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
.G              Em7            C2                       Dsus G
 This is all my righteousness, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.
 
[V5]
 Now by this I'll overcome, nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
 Now by this I'll reach my home, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.</lyrics>
