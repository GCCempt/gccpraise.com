  <lyrics>[V1]
.    Em 
 God rest ye merry, gentlemen,
.    C           B7
 Let nothing you dismay;
.  Em 
 Remember Christ our Savior 
.    C                 B7
 Was born on Christmas Day ||
.   Am               G
 To save us all from Satan's pow'r
.     Em           D
 When we were gone astray.


[C]
.  G          B7          Em
 O tidings of comfort and joy,
.            D
 Comfort and joy;
.  G          B7          Em
 O tidings of comfort and joy.

[V2]
.     Em 
 From God our heavenly Father
.  C             B7
 A blessed angel came,
.    Em 
 And unto certain shepherds 
.        C              B7
 Brought tidings of the same, ||
.    Am            G
 How that in Bethlehem was born
.     Em           D
 The Son of God by name.


[V3]
.      Em 
 "Fear not, then," said the angel,
.     C           B7
 "Let nothing you afright;
.     Em 
 This day is born a Savior 
.     C           B7
 Of a pure virgin bright,||
.   Am                 G
 To free all those who trust in Him
.     Em                D
 From Satan's power and might."

[V4]
.      Em 
 The shepherds at those tidings, 
.     C           B7
 re-joic-ed much in mind,
.     Em 
 And left their flocks a-feeding,
.     C           B7
 in tempest, storm and wind,||
.   Am                 G
 And went to Bethlehem straightway, 
.     Em                D
 the Son of God to find.

[B]                                                                               
.C                                         G                            D 
 Joy to the World for Christ the Lord has finally come
.               C
 Let every heart receive the newborn King
.  Em7                   D                  B7           Em7   Am/C                         
 O come all of heaven and nature sing
.  Em7                   D        Em7   A2/C                        
 O, tidings of comfort and joy
.  Em7                   D        Em7   A2/C                        
 O, tidings of comfort and joy</lyrics>
