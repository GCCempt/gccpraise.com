.G  A/G  D                                                                
 All this pain 
.                G     A/G      D 
 I wonder if I’ll ever find my way 
.           G               A/G  Bm7    Asus   G  A/G  D 
 I wonder if my life could really change at   all

 All this earth 
.                 G     A/G      D 
 Could all that is lost ever be found 
 
.              G       A/G       Bm7    Asus G  A/G  D 
 Could a garden come up from this ground at   all

 Out of chaos life is being found in You
