;Intro: 
.G F#/G Em -- F#/G G (2x)
. G F#/G Em C D Bm C

[V1]
 You came to us, dear Jesus in our dying
. G F#/G Em Bm C
 As broken bleeding, we could make no sign.||
. G F#/G Em C D Bm C
 Compassion Lord, brought you where we were lying
. G F#/G Em F#/G G
 To lift us up, to pour on oil and wine
.G F#/G Em -- F#/G G

[V2]
 You came to us, dear Jesus in our yearning
 As faint and famished, we before you stood;||
 Compassion Lord, our emptiness discerning
 Moved you to multiply the loaves for food

[V3]
 You came to us, dear Jesus in our fearing
 Our dread the lashing waves, the tempest shrill.||
 Compassion Lord, drew you to us and nearing
 To wind and water you said “Peace be still”

[V4]
 You came to us, dear Jesus in our sighing
 For blind and lame and paralyzed we lay.||
 Compassion Lord, turned you to still our crying
 And touch our darkened eyes with light of day.

[V5]
 We come to you, dear Jesus, in your brothers
 in prison, needy, hungry, sick, and cold;||
 compassion Lord, sees you in all these others,
 in touching them our Savior's hand we hold

[V6]
 You Came to us, dear Jesus in your dying
 Your wounds poured love as blood upon the tree.||
 Compassion Lord, from Calvary is crying
 “Bind up their wounds as you would do for me!”

[C]
.C G
 My chains fell off my heart was free
.B7 Em F#/G G
 I rose went forth, and followed thee
.C G
.Tis mercy all immense and free
.B7 Em G F#/G Em F#/G G
 For oh my God it found out me

[E]
 “Bind up their wounds as you would do for me!”
