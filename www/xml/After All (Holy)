[C2]
 Oh, that I may know Him,
 who purchased my life with His blood,
 on the cross ||
 sharing in His sufferings
 becoming like Him in His death
 rising so ||
 On that day when I see,
 my King clothed in all of His power
 and His love||
 I might join the choir
 and sing of His mercies and grace
 with all His beloved

 But it's never loud enough after all.
