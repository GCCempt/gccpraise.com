  <lyrics>[V1]
. C     F     C
 It came upon the midnight clear,
.  F        D7      G7
 That glorious song of old,
.C       F      C 
 From angels bending near the earth
.F          G7       C
 To touch their harps of gold||
.E7                   Am 
 "Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
.G       D7          G
 From heav'n's all-gracious King!"
.C        F      C  
 The world in solemn stillness lay
.F        G7     C
 To hear the angels sing.
 
[V2]
 Still through the cloven skies they come,
 With peaceful wings unfurled;
 And still their heav'nly music floats 
 O'er all the weary world ||
 Above its sad and lowly plains
 They bend on hov-'ring wing,
 And ever o'er its Babel sounds
 The blessed angels sing.
 
[V3]
 And ye beneath life's crushing load,
 Whose forms are bending low,
 Who toil along the climbing way
 With painful steps and slow; ||
 Look now, for glad and golden hours
 Come swiftly on the wing;
 Oh rest beside the weary road
 And hear the angels sing.
 
[V4]
 For lo! the days are hastening on,
 By prophets bards foretold,
 When with the ever-circling years
 Comes round the age of gold. ||
 When peace shall o-ver all the earth
 Its ancient splendors fling,
 And the whole world give back the song
 Which now the angels sing.

.F                   C
 Every high thing must come down
.G                     Dm
 Every stronghold shall be broken

 You wear the Victor's crown

 You wear the Victor's crown
