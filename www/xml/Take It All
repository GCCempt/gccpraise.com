 Searching the world
 The lost will be found

 You carry the cross
 You died and rose again
 My God I’ll only ever give my all

 You sent Your Son

 From Heaven to earth

 Delivered us all
.    (Bb)       (Eb)
 It’s eternally heard ||

 I searched for truth
.      (Bb)      (Eb)     G#m
 And all I found was You
